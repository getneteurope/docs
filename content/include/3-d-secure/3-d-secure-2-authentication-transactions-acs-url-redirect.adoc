| ``three-d/pareq`` | Base64-encoded request message created for cards enrolled in the 3D Secure program. +
The ``PAReq`` is returned by the issuer's ACS via the VISA or Mastercard directory to the {payment-gateway} and from there passed on to the merchant.
| ``TermUrl`` | Web address of your server to receive the ``PARes``, i.e. the Payment Authentication response.
| ``MD`` | Field reserved for specific merchant data. +
It may be useful for retrieving transaction data from the database or recalling a transaction.
|===
+
WARNING: The ``MD`` field is _mandatory._ Make sure to include it in the request. You do not need to enter a value. +
If you omit this field, however, an authentication error occurs and the payment process is aborted.
+
Once the consumer has been redirected, they receive an authentication prompt. The consumer enters their data.
+
After successful authentication, the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed ``PARes`` is posted to the ``TermURL`` via the consumer's browser.
