{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used for one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a _refund_ of one of your _debit_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<{API-PM}, {payment-method-name} specification>> for details on {payment-method-name}-specific post-processing operations.
