[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup]
---
== Basic Setup
---
The device cannot be jail-broken and must run at least iOS 12.0 for
_paymentSDK_ to work. It is recommended to use the latest stable version
of Xcode.

Download the pod at
our link:https://github.com/getneteurope/paymentSDK-iOS[GitHub repository] and
add it to your podfile. 

The iOS supports two ways of MPSDK usage:  

- The first is by selecting all frameworks with payment methods and utilities supported by MPSDK. 

.For example:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
pod 'paymentSDK/All'
----

- The next is a selection of payment methods and utilities by customer preferences. When the customer application uses the card payment only, it needs the Card framework with dependencies only.

.For example:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
pod 'paymentSDK/Card' 
pod 'paymentSDK/SEPA'
----

|AFNetworking
|AFNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It's built on top of the Foundation URL Loading System, extending the powerful high-level networking abstractions built into Cocoa. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs that are a joy to use.

Perhaps the most important feature of all, however, is the amazing community of developers who use and contribute to AFNetworking every day. AFNetworking powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup_Security]
== Security

[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_AuthenticationbySignature]
=== Authentication by Signature

When a payment goes through, there's a lot of data to be exchanged
between various endpoints. Payment information changes hands between
your system (the merchant), the consumer's device, and GetNet Europe Payment Gateway. To ensure that this information is not tampered
with, we need to put safeguards in place.

We do this by employing a _digital signature_, which is used for all
messages targeting the {payment-gateway}. This signature is a mathematical
cipher, which - if validated - proves that the message was created by a
known sender and was not altered while being transmitted.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_SecretKey]
=== Secret Key

You will use your Secret Key when generating the digital signature mentioned above.

The Secret Key is only used in server-side code for either:

- _generating_ the server _request_ signature
- _validating_ the server _response_ signature

//-

If you did not receive your Secret Key at the time you were setting up
your merchant account with us, please contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> and ask for Secret Key generation.


[WARNING]
====
We ask you to *never* share your Secret Key with anyone, or store it
inside your application or phone. This is crucial to ensure the security
of your transactions.
====


[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_Signaturev2]
=== Signature v2

You will be generating the signature on your own server's backend, as it
is the only place where you will store your Secret Key.

Note that when generating the signature for payment SDK, you can leave out
payload fields related to Payment Page
(``redirect_url``, ``custom_css_url``, ``ip_address``). This means that
you only use the mandatory fields.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_2_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_Debugging_prevention]
=== Debugging prevention
---
MPSDK cannot prevent debugging during development without also stopping communication with the test Elastic Engine. This means app developers should be able to debug payments E2E in their code in the simulator or mobile device.

But MPSDK prevents debugging in a production application. For customization and simulation of this option, MPSDK supports *Custom settings* in the project setting on the application side.

Steps of customization:

. Add User-Defined Settings *SDKPay_NO_DEBUG_CHECK* in your project's Build Settings for your application target.

image:images/07-01-basic-setup-and-integraton/iOS/target-properties.png[Custom iOS Target Properties] 

. Set the default value for your AdHoc to *NO* 
. Set other's build configurations by your preferences: 
     - *YES* - without debugging prevention
     - *NO* - with debugging prevention
. Add Custom iOS Target Properties Key to the Info page:
    - *Key:* 'No debugging check'
    - *Value* - $(SDKPay_NO_DEBUG_CHECK)

3D Secure flow & implementation is handled implicitly by _payment SDK_. For a detailed flow, see <<3DS2_Workflow, this link>>.
