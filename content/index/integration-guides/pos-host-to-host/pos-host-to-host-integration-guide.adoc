[#POSHostToHostIntegrationGuide_Workflow]
=== Workflow

The POS setup uses the following workflow to manage transactions between the Payment Service Provider (PSP) and the Payment Gateway:

. The PSP's POS terminal sends a request through the Network Service Provider (NSP) to the Payment Gateway.
. The Payment Gateway processes the request and forwards it to the applicable credit card provider.
. The Payment Gateway sends a response back to the PSP.


[#POSHostToHostIntegrationGuide_TransactionTypes]
=== Transaction Types

For <<Glossary_TransactionType, transaction type>> details which are not given here look at <<AppendixB, Transaction Types>>.
