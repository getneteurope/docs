[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_Ideal_basic_payment]
==== Ideal Payment

This is a code example for a basic Ideal payment:


[source,swift]
----
// 1. Initialize ``SDKPayECClient``
   do {
      try self.client = SDKPayECClient.init(hostname: hostname)
   } catch {
      // the device is checked during initialization for jailbreak.
      // It is risky to make payments on jailbroken devices.
      return
   }

// 2. Initialize payment object and set mandatory properties
// Parameters (amount, currency, transactionType) shall be sent to server for validation or just provided by server
// and used to generate signature. Signature MUST be generated on server side.
// Signature doc: https://docs.getneteurope.com/_mobile_payment_sdk.html#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Security_Signaturev2
// Secret Key shall never be stored in application.

   let payment = SDKPayECIdealPayment()
   payment.amount = AMOUNT
   payment.currency = SDKPayECCurrencyGetISOCode(SDKPayECCurrency.EUR)
   
   payment.transactionType = SDKPayECTransactionType.debit

   let accountHolder = SDKPayECCustomerData.init()
   accountHolder.firstName = "John"
   accountHolder.lastName = "Doe"
   accountHolder.email = "joe.doe@email.com"
   payment.accountHolder = accountHolder
   
   let order = SDKPayECOrder.init()
   order.number = "12345678"
   order.descriptor = "Descriptor"
   payment.order = [order]

```
