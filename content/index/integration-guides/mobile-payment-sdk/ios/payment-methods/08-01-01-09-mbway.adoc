==== MBWay Payment

This is a code example for a basic MBWay payment:


[source,swift]
----
// 1. Initialize ``SDKPayECClient``
   do {
      try self.client = SDKPayECClient.init(hostname: hostname)
   } catch {
      // the device is checked during initialization for jailbreak.
      // It is risky to make payments on jailbroken devices.
      return
   }

// 2. Initialize payment object and set mandatory properties
// Parameters (amount, currency, transactionType) shall be sent to server for validation or just provided by server
// and used to generate signature. Signature MUST be generated on server side.
// Signature doc: https://docs.getneteurope.com/_mobile_payment_sdk.html#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Security_Signaturev2
// Secret Key shall never be stored in application.

   let payment = SDKPayECMBWayPayment()
   payment.amount = AMOUNT
   payment.currency = SDKPayECCurrencyGetISOCode(SDKPayECCurrency.EUR)
   
   payment.transactionType = SDKPayECTransactionType.debit

   let accountHolder = SDKPayECCustomerData.init()
   accountHolder.phone = "913951034"
   accountHolder.phoneCountryCode = "+351"
   payment.accountHolder = accountHolder
   
```
----

//-
[NOTE]
====
In case of providing valid
*`accountHolder.phoneCountryCode`* and *`accountHolder.phone`*
or
*`accountHolder.phone`* which contains both valid country code and phone number
payment flow starts directly, otherwise user will be redirected to screen where phone number needs to be entered.
====

[TIP]
====
You can set optional parameters after the payment object is created. Check the documentation <<API_MBWay_Fields, MBWay>> payment method for more details.
