=== First Steps

Before you start coding, you are going to need some credentials:

. Merchant Account ID - the ID of your merchant account that will be
used to process transactions
. Secret Key - a value that you will use to create unique security
signatures for your transactions

//-

[NOTE]
====
You can find testing credentials at this <<API_CC_TestCards, link>>.

Your account needs to be configured through Merchant Support to process mobile
SDK payments.
====

Get your own credentials by contacting <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

Next, depending on where you are from, you will need to choose your
closest production environment: this is where your instance of MPSDK
will be hosted. Both testing and production environments are available
in every location.

At the moment, the supported locations are as follows:

|===
| Gateway  | Hostname

| Germany - production   | ``\https://{instance-hostname}/``               
| Germany - test   | ``\https://{test-instance-hostname}/`` 
| Singapore - production | ``\https://{instance-hostname}.sg/``
| Singapore - test | ``\https://test.{domain}.sg/``
| UK & Ireland - production | ``\https://{cnd-endpoint}/``
| UK & Ireland - test | ``\https://{cnd-test-endpoint}/``
| Central and Eastern Europe - production | ``\https://{cee-endpoint}/``
| Central and Eastern Europe - test | ``\https://{cee-test-endpoint}/``

WARNING: Don't forget to keep _MPSDK_ up-to-date (i.e. updating before the SSL
certification expires).
