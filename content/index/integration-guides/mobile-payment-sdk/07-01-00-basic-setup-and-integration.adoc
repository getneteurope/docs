== Basic Setup

[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android]
=== Android

The device needs to be non-rooted and run at least Android 4.1 (Jelly
Bean / API Level 16) for _MPSDK_ to work.

.There are two ways to set up the framework on Android
. <<MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_DependencyManager, Using a Dependency Manager>>
. <<MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_AndroidStudio, Importing Through Android Studio>>

//-

[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_DependencyManager]
==== Using a Dependency Manager

With this option, you will be getting _paymentSDK_ straight from the
repository using https://jitpack.io/[JitPack].

First of all, you need to create your project in the Android studio.
Then you add the following code to your ``build.gradle`` file:

[source,java]
----
repositories {
     maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
 dependencies {
     compile 'com.github.wirecard:paymentSDK-Android:2.7.1'
 }
----

Some of our consumers prefer an alternative version of _MPSDK_ which
does not feature the card scanner capability (i.e. scanning the card
information using the phone's camera).

If that's you, add this dependency instead:

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.wirecard:paymentSDK-Android:2.7.1-cardScannerDisabled'
 }
----


[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_AndroidStudio]
==== Importing in Android Studio

After you download the MPSDK package from
https://github.com/wirecard/paymentSDK-Android[our GitHub repository],
use the Android Studio's _Import .JAR/.AAR Package_ option
located in File -> New -> New Module.

Then, add the _MPSDK_ module as a dependency to your ``build.gradle`` file
as shown in the example:

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile project(':paymentsdk')
   ...
 }
----

[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_ExternalLibraries]
==== External Libraries

Our SDK uses various 3rd party libraries which you will need to include
in your ``build.gradle`` file. These should be kept at their latest stable
versions:

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
       ...
       compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.0.1'
       compile 'com.zapp.library:merchant:1.1.0'
       compile 'org.iban4j:iban4j:3.2.1'
       compile 'com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0' //only for card and PayPal payments
       compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0'
       compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.3.0'
       compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:3.8.0'
       compile('com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-simplexml:2.3.0') {
         exclude module: 'stax'
         exclude module: 'stax-api'
         exclude module: 'xpp3'
 }

cardIOEnabledCompile 'io.card:android-sdk:5.5.1'

// iban validator
compile 'org.iban4j:iban4j:3.2.1'
// ocr
compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:11.6.2'
// tracker
compile 'org.piwik.sdk:piwik-sdk:2.0.0'
       ...
 }
----

Including ``io.card:android-sdk`` is optional when using the alternative
_MPSDK_ version (without the card scanner feature).

It is important that you adjust ``com.android.support:appcompat`` to the
latest version of the support library.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_Manifest]
==== _AndroidManifest_ Setup

_MPSDK_ requires these permissions to function:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/MobilePaymentSDKBasicSetupAndroidManifest_MobilePaymentSDKBasicSetupAndroidAndroidStudioImportingThroughAndroidStudio.xml[]
----

If you plan on using the card scanner feature, you will need to:

- add these permissions
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/MobilePaymentSDKBasicSetupAndroidManifest.xml[]
----
+
- add this activity into your _AndroidManifest_ file
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/MobilePaymentSDKBasicSetupAndroidManifest_1.xml[]
----
+
If you do not require the card scanner capability in your app,
you can safely omit this step.
+
For card and _PayPal_ payments, also add:
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/MobilePaymentSDKBasicSetupAndroidManifest_2.xml[]
----

[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_Android_Proguard]
==== Proguard

If you are using https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard[Proguard], you
will need to add the following rules into your ``proguard-rules.pro`` file:

.Rules for Proguard
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
 -dontwarn org.simpleframework.**
 -dontwarn io.card.**
 -dontwarn okhttp3.**
 -dontwarn okio.**
 -dontwarn retrofit2.**
 -dontwarn de.wirecard.paymentsdk.**

 -keepattributes Signature
 -keepattributes Exceptions
 -keepattributes JavascriptInterface
 -keepattributes *Annotation*

 -keep class org.simpleframework.** { *; }
 -keep interface org.simpleframework.** { *; }

 -keep class okhttp3.** { *;}

 -keep class okio.** { *; }
 -keep interface okio.** { *; }

 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; }

 -keep class io.card.**
 -keepclassmembers class io.card.** {
      *;
 }

 -keep class de.wirecard.paymentsdk.** { *; }
 -keep interface de.wirecard.paymentsdk.** { *; }
----

If you are using the alternative version without the card
scanner feature, you can leave out this part:

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
 -keep class io.card.**
 -keepclassmembers class io.card.** {
      *;
----


[#MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup_iOS]
---
=== iOS
---
The device cannot be jail-broken and must run at least iOS 12.0 for
_paymentSDK_ to work. It is recommended to use the latest stable version
of Xcode.

Download the pod at
our link:https://github.com/getneteurope/paymentSDK-iOS[GitHub repository] and
add it to your podfile. 

The iOS supports two ways of MPSDK usage:  

- The first is by selecting all frameworks with payment methods and utilities supported by MPSDK. 

.For example:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
pod 'paymentSDK/All'
----

- The next is a selection of payment methods and utilities by customer preferences. When the customer application uses the card payment only, it needs the Card framework with dependencies only.

.For example:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
pod 'paymentSDK/Card' 
pod 'paymentSDK/SEPA'
----

[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security]
==== Security

[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_AuthenticationbySignature]
===== Authentication by Signature

When a payment goes through, there's a lot of data to be exchanged
between various endpoints. Payment information changes hands between
your system (the merchant), the consumer's device, and GetNet Europe Payment Gateway. To ensure that this information is not tampered
with, we need to put safeguards in place.

We do this by employing a _digital signature_, which is used for all
messages targeting the {payment-gateway}. This signature is a mathematical
cipher, which - if validated - proves that the message was created by a
known sender and was not altered while being transmitted.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_SecretKey]
===== Secret Key

You will use your Secret Key when generating the digital signature mentioned above.

The Secret Key is only used in server-side code for either:

- _generating_ the server _request_ signature
- _validating_ the server _response_ signature

//-

If you did not receive your Secret Key at the time you were setting up
your merchant account with us, please contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> and ask for Secret Key generation.


[WARNING]
====
We ask you to *never* share your Secret Key with anyone, or store it
inside your application or phone. This is crucial to ensure the security
of your transactions.
====


[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_Signaturev2]
===== Signature v2

You will be generating the signature on your own server's backend, as it
is the only place where you will store your Secret Key.

Note that when generating the signature for payment SDK, you can leave out
payload fields related to Payment Page
(``redirect_url``, ``custom_css_url``, ``ip_address``). This means that
you only use the mandatory fields.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_Debugging_prevention]
===== Debugging prevention
---
MPSDK cannot prevent debugging during development without also stopping communication with the test Elastic Engine. This means app developers should be able to debug payments E2E in their code in the simulator or mobile device.

But MPSDK prevents debugging in a production application. For customization and simulation of this option, MPSDK supports *Custom settings* in the project setting on the application side.

Steps of customization:

. Add User-Defined Settings *SDKPay_NO_DEBUG_CHECK* in your project's Build Settings for your application target.

image:images/07-01-basic-setup-and-integraton/iOS/target-properties.png[Custom iOS Target Properties] 

. Set the default value for your AdHoc to *NO* 
. Set other's build configurations by your preferences: 
     - *YES* - without debugging prevention
     - *NO* - with debugging prevention
. Add Custom iOS Target Properties Key to the Info page:
    - *Key:* 'No debugging check'
    - *Value* - $(SDKPay_NO_DEBUG_CHECK)

[#MobilePaymentSDK_iOS_BasicSetup_Security_3DS]
===== 3D Secure
---
3D Secure flow & implementation is handled implicitly by _payment SDK_. For a detailed flow, see <<3DS2_Workflow, this link>>.
