[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration_Overview]
=== Overview

To integrate the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) in your shop, use a simple
backend-to-backend JSON
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, Payment Page Workflow>> for
the payment process.

. *Create a payment session:* You send an initial POST request with
details of the transaction to the Payment Page. This POST
request is secured by basic access authentication.

. *Redirect the consumer to the payment page:* Payment Page returns an initial
response URL.
+
====
* *If the initial POST request is correct*, use the response URL to
redirect the consumer to the payment page. The consumer fills out the
required fields on the payment page and submits the payment. *Continue
with step 3.*

* *If the initial POST request is faulty*, Payment Page returns an error code with
a description of the problem in the response. *Return to step 1.*
====
+
. *Parse and process the payment response:* The payment is processed.
Depending on the result (successful, pending, failed or canceled), the
consumer is redirected to the respective page. The Payment Page sends a POST
request containing base64 encoded payment data to the same URL. It is
_highly recommended_ that you parse and process this base64 encoded
response to verify the payment.
+
*The payment process is complete.*

=== Payment-Processing Example

This is an example of a credit card transaction to show how to process a
payment with the Hosted Payment Page.


The payment-processing example is *designed for the testing environment*
and *does not use real information.*

|===
a|*Payment processing with the {payment-page-v2} generally follows the same steps:*

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-
|===

We provide ready-made JSON samples for each step of this process. Use a
tool such as https://www.postman.com/postman[Postman] to test them.

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration_Example_Create]
.1. Create a Payment Session

To create a payment session, send a *POST request* to the
``/api/payment/register`` endpoint,
e.g. ``\https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/api/payment/register``.


This is an HTTP request with two headers:

.Request Headers
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic NzAwMDAtQVBJREVNTy1DQVJEOm9oeXNTMC1kdmZNeA==
----

The ``Authorization`` header needs to be formatted as:
"Authorization"="Basic"  + base64("username:password")

e.g. ``\https://{pp-redirect-url-cancel}``
|===

====
[WARNING]

To create a payment session with Credit Card using 3D Secure 2 authentication, you need to include <<PPv2_CC_3DS2Fields, 3D Secure 2 fields in your initial request>>. +
Most of these fields are optional but we recommend the implementation of optional fields,
as this creates a smoother user experience and ensures a higher level of security. +
Need more information on 3D Secure 2? Head to our <<CreditCard_3DS2, general introduction to 3D Secure 2>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
*Which Payment Methods Can I Choose?*

Leave out the ``payment-methods`` object from the request. Payment Page will show a
grid of all available payment methods (based on your merchant
configuration).

====

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration_Example_Redirect]
.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page

The response to the initial authorization request contains the
``payment-redirect-url``.

.Response to Authorization Request
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_HPP_IntegrationExampleRedirect_ResponseToAuthorizationRequest.json[]
----

Use the ``payment-redirect-url`` to redirect the consumer.

You can implement the redirection in any way that suits you best.

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration_Example_Redirect_WPPHostedPayUrl]
*Redirecting Consumers to the Payment Page Using ``{payment-page-function-short}.hostedPayUrl``*

You can use our ready-made function to handle the redirection:

. Add the ``paymentPage.js`` library to your checkout page HTML
code
+
[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script src="https://{pp--instance-hostname}/loader/paymentPage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----
+
. Submit the *initial payment request* on the backend.

. Call the ``{payment-page-function-short}.hostedPayUrl(payment-redirect-url)`` function in
your HTML code to redirect the consumer to a new window:
+
[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script type="text/javascript">
{payment-page-function-short}.hostedPayUrl("https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/?wPaymentToken=<DYNAMIC_TOKEN>")
</script>
----
+
Make sure to pass the ``payment-redirect-url`` value from the initial
response to the redirection function and call it.

//-

[NOTE]
====
The consumer is redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. The response can

- be successful (``transaction-state: success``)
- fail (``transaction-state: failed``)
- or the consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is displayed as the value
of ``transaction-state`` in the payment response. Canceled payments are
returned as ``"transaction-state" : "failed"``, but the status description
indicates it was canceled. More information (including the status code)
can also be found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object.

In any case, a base64 encoded response containing payment information is
sent to the corresponding redirection URL
(``success-redirect-url``, ``cancel-redirect-url``, or ``fail-redirect-url``).

See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for Payment Page>>
for more information on redirection targets
after payment.
====

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration_Example_Parse]
.3. Parse and Process the Payment Response (Highly Recommended)

*Where Can I Find the Payment Response?*

Payment Page sends the final response to the success/fail page where the consumer
is redirected to at the end of the payment session. *This final response
contains the payment data* in a base64 encoded JSON format. It is sent
with a POST request as form data ``response-base64``.

image::images/03-01-01-01-hpp-integration/Base64_v2_1.png[Base64]

Before you are able to parse and process the payment response, you need
to decode it.

*To test this*

- Copy and paste the ``payment-redirect-url`` into your browser.
- Open your browser's console and complete the payment with the credit
card information provided above.
- In your browser's console, find the form data ``response-base64``
(see screenshot).
- Copy and paste the response into a base64 decoder of your choice, e.g.
https://www.base64decode.org/[Base64 Decode].
- Decode the response to view the payment response details.

//-

You can find a decoded payment response example below.
