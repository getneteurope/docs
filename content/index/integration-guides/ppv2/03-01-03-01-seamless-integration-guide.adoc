[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Overview]
=== Overview

To integrate the {payment-page-v2} in Seamless Mode in your shop,
get your checkout page ready in two steps:

. *Preparing your checkout page:* Add the ``paymentPage.js`` library to
your checkout page's HTML code.

. *Changing the background color setting in Payment Page Designer:* Set
the background color to transparent in Payment Page Designer.

//-

Then use a backend-to-backend JSON <<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, workflow>>
for the payment process.

. *Create a payment session:* You send an initial POST request with
details of the transaction to the {payment-page-v2}. This POST
request is secured by basic access authentication.

. *Render the seamless payment form:* Payment Page returns an initial response URL.
+
====
- *If the initial POST request is correct,* use this response URL and the
``{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessRender`` library call to render the payment form in a
seamless iframe. *Continue with step 3.*

- *If the initial POST request is faulty,* Payment Page returns an error code with
a description of the problem in the response. *Return to step 1.*
====
+
. *Submit the payment:* The consumer fills in the payment form. Use
the ``{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessSubmit`` function to submit the payment. Ensure that
the function is bound to an interactive UI element, such as a button, in
your HTML code.
- *3D Secure credit card payment* automatically redirects the consumer
to the authentication page, and then to a Payment Page success- or
fail-redirect-url. Include the success- and fail-redirect-urls in your
initial request! This page includes a JSON sample for 3D Secure credit
card payment.
- *Non-3D Secure credit card payment* requires you to implement
redirects to subsequent pages, such as a ``success-/fail-/cancel-redirect-url`` to let the consumer know about the
payment outcome, by yourself.
+
. *Parse and Process the Payment Response:* The payment is processed.
Payment Page returns base64 encoded payment data. It is _highly recommended_ that
you parse and process this base64 encoded response to verify the
payment.


[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_FirstSteps]
=== First Steps

Before processing payments in Seamless Mode, you need to make a small adjustment to your checkout page's HTML code, and change a setting in
the Payment Page Designer.

.1. Preparing your Checkout Page

Add the ``paymentPage.js`` library to your checkout page HTML code:

[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script src="https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/loader/paymentPage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----

This library lets you render the payment form as an iframe in your checkout page.

WARNING: The URL included here serves only as an example. Please enter the domain
of the instance received during merchant configuration.

.2. Changing the Background Color Setting in Payment Page Designer

Open the Payment Page Designer to set the background color to
*transparent.* Transparency of the card form's background ensures a
seamless appearance when it is embedded in your checkout page.

. Select the *Payment* tab and click on *Colors.*
+
image::images/03-01-03-01-seamless-integration-guide/seamless_ppd_1.png[Seamless Page Designer 1]
+
. In *Colors,* go to the *Content* tab and open the *Content Background Color* window.
+
image::images/03-01-03-01-seamless-integration-guide/seamless_ppd_2.png[Seamless Page Designer 2]
+
. Set the *Content Background Color* alpha value (*A*) to *0*

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example]
=== Payment-Processing Example

This is an example of a credit card 3D Secure transaction to show how to process a payment with the {payment-page-v2} in Seamless Mode.
Currently, Seamless Mode supports *only credit card payments.* For a more payment-method-specific integration guide, go to <<PPv2_CC, Credit Card>>.

The payment-processing example is *designed for the testing environment* and *does not use real information.*

Payment processing with {payment-page-v2} in Seamless Mode deviates a little bit from the

<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, HPP>> and <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, EPP>> payment processing workflow:

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_3DS2]
====
[WARNING]

To create a payment session with Credit Card using 3D Secure 2 authentication, you need to include <<PPv2_CC_3DS2Fields, 3D Secure 2 fields in your initial request>>. +
Most of these fields are optional but we recommend the implementation of optional fields,
as this creates a smoother user experience and ensures a higher level of security. +
Need more information on 3D Secure 2? Head to our <<CreditCard_3DS2, general introduction to 3D Secure 2>>.
====


[CAUTION]
====
You must include ``"options": {"mode":"seamless"}`` in your request, otherwise Payment Page returns a regular payment URL that cannot be used in
Seamless Mode. +

Seamless Mode renders the payment form into an iframe. Therefore, you
need to include ``"options": {`"frame-ancestor": "url"}`` in the request with your domain as the ``"url"`` value. +
If you do not send ``"frame-ancestor"`` in the request, browsers will refuse to display the payment page in the iframe due to HTTP security
policy.
====


[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_Render]
.2. Render the Seamless Payment Form

The response to the initial authorization request contains the
``payment-redirect-url``.

.Response to Authorization Request
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/WPP_SeamlessIntegrationExampleRender_ResponseToAuthorizationRequest.json[]
----

Use the *``{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessRender``* function to render the payment form in a seamless iframe.
Include the ``payment-redirect-url`` here:

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessRender({
    url: paymentredirecturl, // this is the payment link returned in response to your initial request
    wrappingDivId: "seamless-form-target",
    onSuccess: function (response) { // called when seamless form is successfully rendered
    },
    onError: function (errResp) { // called if seamless form failed to render
    }
});
----

WARNING: This function renders only the payment form! The button with which
consumers confirm their payment must be part of your checkout page.
Bind the function to an interactive UI element, such as a button, in
your HTML code.

WARNING: *The function only submits the payment.*

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_3DSRedirect]
*3D Secure Transaction Redirect*

For 3D Secure transactions, Payment Page in Seamless Mode automatically
redirects the consumer to the card provider 3D Secure authentication
pages. There are no actions required from you for this process.

After 3D Secure authentication, the payment is further processed.

Depending on the outcome, the consumer is redirected to a
``success-/fail-/cancel-redirect-url``. As the consumer leaves your page
for 3D Secure authentication, these URLs need to be set up in the same
way as those for <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, HPP>> and <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, EPP>>
integrations.

[NOTE]
====
This means that *for 3D Secure Transactions, you need to include the ``success-/fail-/cancel-redirect-url`` in the initial request!*

URLs for successful, failed, and canceled transactions can also be set
during the initial merchant configuration and saved in the database. If
you would like to change these default values, please contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

More information on ``success-/fail-/cancel-redirect-url`` configuration
can be found in <<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for Payment Page>>.
====

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_Redirect]
*Non 3D Secure Transaction Redirect*

For Non-3D Secure transactions, any further steps, such as displaying
success messages to your consumer, or redirecting your consumer to
success-/fail-/cancel-pages, need to be implemented separately in your
online shop.

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_Parse]
.4. Parse and Process the Payment Response (Highly Recommended)

Once you have submitted the payment, and it has been processed, you
receive a payment response. The payment response is sent in three parts:
the ``response-signature-base64``, the ``response-signature-algorithm``,
and the ``response-base64``.

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/WPP_SeamlessIntegrationExampleParse_4ParseAndProcessThePaymentResponseHighlyRecommended.json[]
----

- ``response-base64`` contains the payment data.
- ``response-signature-base64`` and the ``response-signature-algorithm``, together with the Secret Key you receive upon signing a contract with
{payment-provider-name}, are required for calculating the security response signature.
The security response signature is essential for verifying the payment
status. +
*Please consult <<PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security, Payment Page Security>> for details and examples of response signature verification.*

//-

In Seamless Mode, the Payment Page sends the final response containing the payment data to either of the following destinations, depending on the
payment mode.

[#PPv2_Seamless_Integration_Example_Parse_3DS]
*3D Secure Credit Card Payment*

The Payment Page sends the final response containing the payment data to the
``success-redirect-url``/``fail-redirect-url`` *specified in the initial request.* This is the URL where the consumer is redirected to at the end
of a payment session.

To parse and process the payment response of 3D Secure credit card
payment, please consult *<<PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security, Payment Page Security>> for details.*

This is the decoded payment data contained in the example payment response provided above.
