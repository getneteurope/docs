[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration_Overview]
=== Overview

To integrate the Embedded Payment Page (EPP) in your shop, use a simple
backend-to-backend JSON
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, workflow>> for
the payment process.

. *Create a payment session:* You send an initial POST request with
details of the transaction to the {payment-page-v2} Payment Page. This POST
request is secured by basic access authentication.

. *Render/create the payment page:* Payment Page returns an initial response
URL.
+
====
* *If the initial POST request is correct*, use the response URL to
render the embedded payment page as an overlay to the checkout page. The
consumer fills out the required fields on the payment page and submits
the payment. *Continue with step 3.*

* *If the initial POST request is faulty*, Payment Page returns an error code
with a description of the problem in the response. *Return to step 1.*

//-
====
+
. *Parse and process the payment response:* The payment is processed.
Depending on the result (successful, pending, failed or canceled), the
consumer is redirected to the respective page. The Payment Page sends a POST
request containing base64 encoded payment data to the same URL. It is
_highly recommended_ that you parse and process this base64 encoded
response to verify the payment.
+
*The payment process is complete.*

=== Payment-Processing Example

This is an example of a credit card transaction to show how to process a
payment with the Embedded Payment Page. +
For more supported payment methods and payment-method-specific
integration guides, go to
<<PPv2_SupportedPaymentMethods, Payment Methods with Payment Page>>.

The payment-processing example is *designed for the testing environment*
and *does not use real information.*

|===
a|*Payment processing with the {payment-page-v2} generally follows the same steps:*

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Render the embedded payment page.
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

We provide ready-made JSON samples for each step of this process. Use a
tool such as https://www.postman.com/postman[Postman] to test them.

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration_Example_Create]
.1. Create a Payment Session

To create a payment session, send a *POST request* to the
``/api/payment/register`` endpoint,
e.g. ``\https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/api/payment/register``.

This is an HTTP request with two headers:

.Request Headers
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic NzAwMDAtQVBJREVNTy1DQVJEOm9oeXNTMC1kdmZNeA==
----

The Authorization header must be formatted as:
``Authorization=Basic `` + base64 (``username:password``)

You can try it using the authorization headers above.

====
[WARNING]

To create a payment session with Credit Card using 3D Secure 2 authentication, you need to include <<PPv2_CC_3DS2Fields, 3D Secure 2 fields in your initial request>>. +
Most of these fields are optional but we recommend the implementation of optional fields,
as this creates a smoother user experience and ensures a higher level of security. +
Need more information on 3D Secure 2? Head to our <<CreditCard_3DS2, general introduction to 3D Secure 2>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
*Which Payment Methods Can I Choose?*

Leave out the ``payment-methods`` object from the request. Payment Page will show a
grid of all available payment methods (based on your merchant
configuration).

Alternatively, check out <<PPv2_SupportedPaymentMethods, Payment Methods with Payment Page>>
for an overview of all supported payment methods.
====

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration_Example_Embed]
.2. Embed the Payment Page

The payment page is in this case an overlay window. It is created using
the ``payment-redirect-url``, contained in the response to the initial
authorization request.

.Response to Authorization Request

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration_Example_Embed_WPPEmbeddedPayUrl]
*Embedding the Payment Page in your Checkout Page Using ``{payment-page-function-short}.embeddedPayUrl``*

You can use our predefined function to embed the payment page:

. Add the ``paymentPage.js`` library to your checkout page HTML
code.
+
[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script src="https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/loader/paymentPage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----
+
Make sure to pass the ``payment-redirect-url`` value from the initial
response to the ``{payment-page-function-short}.embeddedPayUrl`` function and call it to render the
payment page.

. Submit the *initial payment request* on the backend.

. Call the ``{payment-page-function-short}.embeddedPayUrl(payment-redirect-url)`` function
in your HTML code to render the new pop-up window.
+
[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script type="text/javascript">{payment-page-function-short}.embeddedPayUrl("https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/?wPaymentToken=<DYNAMIC_TOKEN>")</script>
----

//-

[NOTE]
====
The consumer is redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. The response can
either:

- be successful (``transaction-state: success``)
- fail (``transaction-state: failed``)
- or the consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is displayed as the value
of ``transaction-state`` in the payment response. Canceled payments are
returned as ``"transaction-state" : "failed"``, but the status description
indicates it was canceled. More information (including the status code)
can also be found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object.

In any case, a base64 encoded response containing payment information is
sent to the corresponding redirection URL
(``success-redirect-url``, ``cancel-redirect-url``, or ``fail-redirect-url``).

See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for Payment Page>>
for more information on redirection targets
after payment.
====

[#PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration_Example_Parse]
.Parse and Process the Payment Response (Highly Recommended)

*Where Can I Find the Payment Response?*

Payment Page sends the final response to the success/fail page where the consumer
is redirected to at the end of the payment session. *This final response
contains the payment data* in a base64 encoded JSON format. It is sent
with a POST request as form data ``response-base64``.

image::images/03-01-02-01-epp-integration-guide/EPP_Base64.png[Base64]

Before you are able to parse and process the payment response, you need
to decode it.

*To test this:*

- Copy and paste the ``payment-redirect-url`` into your browser.
- Open your browser's console and complete the payment with the credit card information provided above.

- In your browser's console, find the form data ``response-base64``
(see screenshot).
- Copy and paste the response into a base64 decoder of your choice, e.g.
https://www.base64decode.org/[Base64 Decode].
- Decode the response to view the payment response details.

//-

You can find a decoded payment response example below.
