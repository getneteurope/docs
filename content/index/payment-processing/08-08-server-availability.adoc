[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ServerAvailability]
== Server Availability

When you want to find out, whether the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_ servers are available, you
can use a link to the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_ status page:

https://{instance-hostname}/engine/rest/ping

The status page shows the general status of the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.

It also shows the online status of database and tokenization server.

For reference you can also see the current server time.

Please use a slash "/" after "status", otherwise this page will ask for
credentials.

Please be aware that each server request means data traffic. Use this
request carefully. Use it only, if you encounter server connection
problems.
