The face of e-commerce has changed drastically since 3D Secure 1 was first introduced almost two decades ago. Mobile and in-app payment is booming, a seamless shopping experience more important than ever, and the demands on security growing.

As a result, the https://www.emvco.com/about/overview/[EMVCo] has devised a new standard authentication method for payment card transactions: *3D Secure 2 (3DS2).* 

This state-of-the-art protocol fulfills the <<CreditCard_PSD2_SCA, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)>> requirements set by the https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en[EU's Second Payment Services Directive (PSD 2)] for online payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).

[NOTE]
====
3DS2 is not yet supported in the APAC region. Please contact your relationship manager for more information.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_Why]
[discrete]
=== Why Adopt 3D Secure 2?

*3D Secure 2* is set to become the prime
authentication method for online card payments, thanks to a number of
updates that improve not only the security, but also the consumer
experience of 3D Secure 1 (3DS1):

//The 3D Secure 2 protocol has been
//designed for this brave new world and offers the flexibility needed to
//adapt to an ever-changing e-commerce landscape.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_Advantages]

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| *No More Static Passwords*
| The days of rummaging through your drawers to find your 3D Secure password are over. Consumers will no longer have to look for their passwords and are more likely to complete their purchases.
| *Two-Factor Authentication*
| 3DS2 implements two-factor authentication.
//<<CreditCard_PSD2, two-factor-authentication>>, as required by PSD 2. 
To make the experience more convenient for consumers, authentication can be completed, for example, with a token and a simple thumbprint.
| *Fewer False Declines*
| The new protocol provides ten times more information to the issuers, which helps drastically reduce the number of false declines. Consumers will retain their trust in 3DS2-secured transactions.
| *Mobile-Enabled Security*
| Consumers will no longer be redirected to potentially non-mobile-ready authorization pages.
| *Less Cart Abandonment*
| Overall greater convenience, a faster checkout process, and a seamless shopping experience will reduce shopping cart abandonment by 70%.
| *Merchant Opt-Out*
| As a merchant, if you decide for 3DS2, you regain the freedom to choose which transactions you send through the protocol and which ones you don't. However, please keep in mind that issuers may have to decline the transaction because SCA is required on their side.
|===

As with 3DS1, 3D Secure 2 also protects the merchant from liability in cases of fraud.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_PSD2]
=== Recurring MIT and PSD 2

[#CreditCard_3DS2_PSD2_Grandfathering]
==== Grandfathering

Since 14 September 2019, the PSD 2 Regulatory Technical Standard requires SCA for 3D Secure 2 payment processes. This also applies to recurring payments (see 
https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-7782-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF[Article 14 RTS]). From that day on, every first transaction of a recurring merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) must meet the standards of PSD 2.

However, a _special exemptive status_ applies to ongoing recurring MITs whose _first transaction was processed before 14 September 2019._ Recurring MITs of that kind are being "grandfathered".

If {payment-provider-name} is your acquirer, the {payment-gateway} can "grandfather" a recurring MIT if you provide the referencing ``transaction-id`` from the *first* ``authorization`` or ``purchase`` transaction.

{payment-provider-name} will then identify the correct Trace ID (Mastercard) or Transaction Identifier (Visa) of this recurring MIT and send it to the issuer.
