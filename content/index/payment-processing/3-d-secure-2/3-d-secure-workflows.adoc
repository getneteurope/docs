[#3DS2_Workflow]
== Workflows

Generally, the 3D Secure 2 workflow remains identical to the 3D Secure 1 workflow. Unlike 3D Secure 1 though, 3D Secure 2 introduces the opportunity for frictionless authentication. Thus, 3D Secure 2 transactions can follow either a frictionless or a challenge flow. Based on provided data and resultant risk analysis, the issuing bank decides which flow is triggered.

- *Frictionless Flow:* The consumer is authenticated passively. No further consumer interaction is required. 
- *Challenge Flow:* An authentication challenge is triggered. The consumer is prompted to provide further information.

+
NOTE: Sending specific 3D Secure 2 fields in the initial payment request reduces the likelihood of an authentication challenge. More details on 3D Secure 2 fields can be found in the <<CreditCard_3DS2_Fields, 3D Secure 2 Fields>> section.

If the issuer does not support 3D Secure 2, an automatic fallback to 3D Secure 1 is initiated.

Find the schematic diagrams for Frictionless Flow, Challenge Flow and Fallback to 3D Secure 1 below.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to distinguish between the terms *authentication* and *authorization:*

- Authentication confirms the cardholder's identity.
- Authorization checks whether the cardholder's account holds sufficient funds and reserves the respective amount for later payment.

=== 3D Secure 2.1 Frictionless Flow

*1.* _Check-Enrollment_: Checks if the consumer’s card is enrolled in the 3D Secure 2 program. +
*1.1* Consumer (cardholder) checkout on your payment page. +
*1.2* Initiate the payment session with {payment-gateway} using the check-enrollment transaction type. Provide additional fields for 3D Secure 2 transactions. 3D Secure 2 fields can be found in the <<CreditCard_3DS2_Fields, 3D Secure 2 Fields>> section. They are also included in the <<Appendix_Xml, REST API payment XSD>>. +
*1.3* {payment-gateway} checks the 3D Secure version supported by the issuer with the 3D Secure server. +
*1.4* {payment-gateway} returns the check-enrollment response. It includes the ACS URL, the ``PAReq`` and the 3D Secure version. +

*2.* _Redirect the Consumer to the ACS URL_ +
*2.1* Send an <<3DS2_IntegrationGuide_REST_AutoSubmission, HTTPS POST request>> including the ACS URL, the ``PAReq``, ``TermUrl`` and ``MD``. +
*2.2* The ACS URL points to the public endpoint of the {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router which decodes the ``PAReq``. +
*2.3* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router returns an HTML with the scheme logo and a "processing" screen which is displayed in the consumer's browser. +
*2.4* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router redirects the consumer to the 3DSMethodURL for device fingerprinting. +
*2.5* The Issuer ACS gathers the information and redirects the 3D Secure method completion information to the
{payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router URL. +
*2.6* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router initiates authentication with the issuer's ACS via the scheme directory server. +
*2.7* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router posts the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed ``PARes`` (Payment Authentication Response) to the TermURL via the consumer’s browser. +

*3.* _Check-Payer-Response_ _(optional) and_ _PARes_ _Verification_: Use this request to receive, analyze and store authentication values.  The check-payer-response returns the authentication values needed in the payment transaction that follows. It is executed _after_ you receive the check-enrollment response and the ``PARes``. +
*3.1* Send a POST request with transaction type check-payer-response to {payment-gateway}. Provide the ``parent-transaction-id`` using the ``transaction-id`` from the check-enrollment response, and the ``PARes``. +
*3.2* {payment-gateway} decodes the ``PARes``, checks the signature and retrieves the final authentication values. +
*3.3* {payment-gateway} returns the final authentication values in the response of the check-payer-response transaction. These include the ``dsTransId``, ``CAAV/AVV``, ``ECI``, ``authenticationStatus`` and the 3D Secure version (expected 2.1.0). +

*4.* _Complete the Payment Transaction_: Proceed with the respective transaction type (e.g. authorization, purchase, authorization-only). Use the final authentication values received either from the check-enrollment response (e.g. ``PARes`` and ``parent-transaction-id``), or from step 3.3 (check-payer-response response).
