[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_DelayedShipment]
=== Delayed Shipment

A consumer places an order for a product or service. The merchant fulfills the order in a single shipment, but with a delay. This delay may be expected or unexpected and could exceed the expiration date of the _authorization._

NOTE: *Pre-authorization* is valid longer than a regular *authorization.*

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_DelayedShipment_tx]
==== For a successful transaction:

.Option 1: Expected delay
. *Check-enrollment* (full amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization-only* (zero amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization-only``. This request serves to validate the credit card data.
+
_When ready to ship..._
+
. *Authorization* (full amount): Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
. *Capture* (full amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the previous _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

//-


.Option 2: Unexpected delay

. *Check-enrollment* (full amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *(Pre-)authorization* (full amount): Send a second request with transaction type (``pre-``)``authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
+
_When exceeding the expiration date of the authorization_
+
. *Void-authorization*: Send a request with transaction type ``void-authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the (_pre-_)_authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
+
_When ready to ship (MIT)..._
+
. *Authorization* (full amount) as _merchant-initiated transaction_ (MIT): Merchant-initiated transactions are out of scope of SCA (Strong Customer Authentication); therefore, ``check-enrollment`` is not required prior to this request. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the (_pre-_)_authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
. *Capture* (full amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the previous _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_PartialSplitShipment]
=== Partial/ Split Shipment

A consumer places an order for a product or service. The merchant fulfills the order in multiple shipments.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_PartialSplitShipment_tx]
==== For a successful transaction:

.Option 1: Without delay

. *Check-enrollment* (full amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization* (full amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field. If the request is successful, the response contains a new _transaction-id_.

//-


.Option 2: With (partial) delay (if shipping takes longer than *authorization* is valid)

. *Check-enrollment* (full amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization* (full amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field. If the request is successful, the response contains a new _transaction-id_.
+
_Whenever a part of the order is ready to ship_
+
. *Capture* (partial amount):  Send a third request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the previous _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field. Capture every individual shipment.
+
_When authorization expires_
+
. *Void-authorization* (remaining amount): Void the remaining amount with a ``void-authorization`` request.
+
_Whenever a remaining part of the order is ready to ship_
+
. *Authorization* (remaining amount) as _merchant-initiated transaction_ (MIT): Merchant-initiated transactions are out of scope of SCA (Strong Customer Authentication); therefore, ``check-enrollment`` is not required prior to this request.
. *Capture* the remaining amount. Capture every individual shipment.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_Recurring_Same]
=== Recurring Payments - Same Amount (Merchant-Initiated Transaction)

Recurring transactions are processed at regular intervals, with the same, recurring amount. When you set up a recurring _merchant-initiated transaction_ (MIT) agreement, the first transaction requires _Strong Customer Authentication_ (one-time only).
A common business scenario would be subscription fees for a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, or for video streaming services.

WARNING: Consumers must be clearly informed about the terms of the agreement when setting up the recurring payment plan.

.Option 1: Amount due at sign-up (no trial period)

_Setting up the agreement (consumer-initiated)_

. *Check-enrollment* (amount due at sign-up): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>recurring</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization* (amount due at sign-up): Send a request with transaction type ``authorization``. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>recurring</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment._
. *Capture* (amount due at sign-up): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
+
_Recurring payment (MIT)_
+
. *Authorization* (recurring amount) as _merchant-initiated transaction_ (MIT): Merchant-initiated transactions are out of scope of SCA (Strong Customer Authentication); therefore, ``check-enrollment`` is not required prior to this request. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>recurring</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>recurring</sequence-type>``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the *first* _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field (see step 2).
. *Capture* (recurring amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the *second* _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

//-

.Option 2: No amount due at sign-up (with trial period)

_Setting up the agreement (consumer-initiated)_

. *Check-enrollment* (zero amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>recurring</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization-only* (zero amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization-only``. This request serves to sign the payment agreement. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>recurring</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_Recurring_Variable]
=== Recurring Payments - Variable Amount and Fixed frequency

For recurring payments with a variable amount, the consumer agrees that the merchant may initiate one or more transactions in the future. These merchant-initiated _UCOF_ (Unscheduled Credential on File) transactions use stored credentials. The transactions are unscheduled and happen in irregular intervals. The payment amount is either fixed or variable. UCOF _merchant-initiated transaction_ agreements have to be set up with Strong Customer Authentication.
Examples include automatic top-up transactions, e.g. for mobile phones and online gaming.

WARNING: Consumers must be clearly informed about the terms of the unscheduled credential on file at the time of sign-up.

.Option 1: Amount due at sign-up

_Setting up the agreement (consumer-initiated)_

. *Check-enrollment* (amount due at sign-up): This is the initial request. It initiates the payment session and the agreement set-up. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>ucof</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization* (amount due at sign-up): Send a request with transaction type ``authorization``. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>ucof</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _check-enrollment._

+
_Per UCOF payment (MIT)_
+
. *Authorization* (UCOF amount) as _merchant-initiated transaction_ (MIT): Merchant-initiated transactions are out of scope of SCA (Strong Customer Authentication); therefore, ``check-enrollment`` is not required prior to this request. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>ucof</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>recurring</sequence-type>``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the *first* _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field (see step 2).
. *Capture* (UCOF amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the UCOF _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

//-

.Option 2: No amount due at sign-up

_Setting up the agreement (consumer-initiated)_

. *Check-enrollment* (zero amount): This is the initial request. It initiates the payment session and the agreement set-up. The request must contain ``<periodic-type>ucof</periodic-type>`` and ``<sequence-type>first</sequence-type>``. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization-only* (zero amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization-only``. This request serves to sign the payment agreement.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_AgentModel]
=== Agent Model

The consumer interacts with an agent that is selling another merchant's product or service. Payments are triggered by merchants. One example for this would be an online travel agency.

WARNING: Agents must clearly inform consumers that their cards will be charged by merchants and not by agents.

You are an agent with {payment-provider-name}.

.For a successful transaction:

_Initiate the payment session_:

. *Check-Enrollment* (full amount) +
This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a ``transaction-id``, and the ``three-d/pareq``. The _PAReq_ is the digitally signed, base64-encoded authentication request message created by _{payment-gateway}._ It contains the results of the 3D Secure versioning request that is used to initiate _AReq_ as part of the HTTPS POST redirect to the ACS URL. The agent uses the PAReq for a HTTPS POST redirect to the ACS URL, which is part of a standard 3D Secure process. The HTTPS POST redirect returns the PARes as part of the response.
. *Check-Payer-Response* +
This request serves to provide the authentication values needed later on in the _authorization._ The _check-payer-response_ is executed after the _check-enrollment_ response and the PARes have been received. The _check-payer-response_ must contain the following fields
 - ``three-d/pares``: This is the digitally signed, base64-encoded authentication response message containing ARes/CRes received from the issuer.
 - ``parent-transaction-id``: Use the value returned in the ``transaction-id`` field of the _check-enrollment_ response.
The _check-payer-response_ includes the ``three-d/cardholder-authentication-value``.
+
Provide the final authentication values for the merchant. These values include:
+
 - ``three-d/cardholder-authentication-value``
 - ``three-d/eci``
 - ``three-d/ds-transaction-id``
 - ``three-d/version``
 - ``three-d/cardholder-authentication-status``

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_OpenOrders]
=== Open Orders (with an unknown payment amount before purchase)

The consumer places an order for a certain amount. However, the amount is expected to change by the time of shipping.
For example, this could apply to orders where a shipping date is booked several days or weeks in advance, but the shopping cart contents can be changed until the time of shipping.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_OpenOrders_tx]
==== For a successful transaction:

.Option 1: Initial order amount

. *Check-enrollment* (initial order amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization-only* (zero amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization-only``. This request serves to validate the credit card data.
+
_If the shopping cart content changes and the new total amount exceeds the original amount_
+
. *Check-enrollment* (new total amount): To authenticate the new total amount, a new _check-enrollment_ is needed. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
+
_When ready to ship..._
+
. *Authorization* (latest enrolled amount): Send a request with transaction type ``authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _latest_ *check-enrollment* response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field. If the request is successful, the response contains a new _transaction-id_.
. *Capture* (latest enrolled amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

//-

NOTE: This option is more expensive because more enrollment-checks are necessary.


.Option 2: Estimated maximum amount

. *Check-enrollment* (estimated maximum amount): This is the initial request and initiates the payment session. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
. *Authorization-only* (zero amount): Send a second request with transaction type ``authorization-only``. This request serves to validate the credit card data.
+
_When adding items (only if the total amount exceeds the estimated maximum amount)_
+
. *Check-enrollment* (new total amount): To authenticate the new total amount, a new _check-enrollment_ is needed. If the request is successful, the response contains a _transaction-id._
+
_When ready to ship..._
+
. *Authorization* (latest enrolled amount): Send a request with transaction type ``authorization``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _latest_ *check-enrollment* response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field. If the request is successful, the response contains a new _transaction-id_.
. *Capture* (latest enrolled amount): Send a request with transaction type ``capture``. Include the ``transaction-id`` from the _authorization_ response in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.

//-

NOTE: This option may have a higher abandonment rate. The authentication prompt asks the consumer to authenticate a higher amount than expected.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_Installments]
=== Installments (MIT)

Payment in installments occurs when a consumer purchases goods and settles the bill with multiple partial payments (plus interest) over an agreed period of time.

== Special 3D Secure 2 Use Cases

include::{root}/index/payment-processing/3-d-secure-2/use-cases/one-click-checkout.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

'''
[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_Special_ChangingTerms]
=== Changing Terms of an Existing Payment Agreement (MIT)

Existing payment agreements may change. Such changes could be initiated by both merchants and consumers.
Whenever a payment agreement changes, a _check-enrollment_ for the new amount is recommended. Merchants may decide against a new _check-enrollment_ in certain business scenarios.

Examples include up- and downgrades of subscription plans for video streaming services, changes to the billing cycle, as well as pausing, resuming, and canceling a subscription.


.Scenario 1: Merchant-driven agreement changes

If a change is initiated by merchants, ``check-enrollment`` is not needed if the original agreement with the consumer (e.g. the terms and conditions) clearly covers the eventuality of such changes. One example could be price changes due to inflation, or video streaming services changing their subscription fees.

.Scenario 2: Consumer-driven agreement changes

If a change is initiated by consumers, authentication is only required, if the agreed payment terms clearly cover the eventuality of such changes and the merchant has appropriate risk management in place. In case there are any doubts that the original agreement covers the change, treating the transaction as a new agreement by performing a _check-enrollment_ request (for the new amount) is highly recommended. Examples include consumers up- or downgrading their software subscriptions.

'''
[#CreditCard_3DS2_UseCase_MOTO_Transactions]
=== Mail Order Telephone Order (MOTO) Transactions

NOTE: To process MOTO transactions, your merchant account must be configured accordingly (contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>).

Mail Order Telephone Order (MOTO) transactions are not considered electronic payments and, as such,
are out of scope of SCA (Strong Customer Authentication). To process MOTO transactions (authorizations and purchases) without SCA, they must be marked accordingly.

How to mark a transaction as MOTO depends on your merchant account configuration:

- *MOTO-exclusive setup:* In case your merchant account is set up for executing MOTO transactions only, MOTO is assigned as the default commerce type. If the ``payment/entry-mode`` field of the payment request is left empty, the respective transaction is marked as MOTO by default.

- *Mixed setup:* In case your merchant account is set up for executing both MOTO transactions and e-commerce transactions, e-commerce is assigned as the default commerce type. To mark a transaction as MOTO, set the ``payment/entry-mode`` field to either ``mail-order`` or ``telephone-order`` in the payment request.
+
====
WARNING: *Mixed setup:* If the ``payment/entry-mode`` field of the payment request is left empty, the respective transaction is marked as e-commerce by default and thus subject to SCA.
