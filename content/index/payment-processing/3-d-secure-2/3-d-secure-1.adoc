.3D Secure in a Nutshell

- Payment standard introduced in 2001 by VISA that provides secure authentication and processing of online card payments 
// - Not only a payment authentication method, but allows also for <<3DSecureLiabilityShift, liability shift>> in cases of fraud
- Protects merchants from fraudulent losses by allowing for liability shift after successful cardholder authentication
- Three domains: merchant (acquirer), cardholder (issuer) and card scheme
- 3DS 1.0.2 has been discontinued by the card schemesÂ in October 2022
// - Originally exclusively designed for browser-based authentication
