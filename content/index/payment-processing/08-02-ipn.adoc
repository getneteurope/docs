[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN]
== Instant Payment Notification

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Introduction]

The {payment-gateway} has a built-in _notification_ capability.
An _Instant Payment Notification_ (IPN) informs the merchant about the
final status of a transaction.

There are two types of notifications:

- *HTTPS* (Web Server POST)

//-

The following formats are currently supported:

- application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- application/xml
- application/json
- application/json-signed

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Configuration]
=== Configuration

When the merchant wants to receive a notification, he can either

- specify a URL as part the merchant account setup; or
- include either an email address or a URL as part of each transaction
request

//-

[NOTE]
====
- The definition of URL and format type in the transaction request
overwrites the configured definition in the merchant account setup.
- Only those notifications sent via URL contain a signature.
====

For request based IPN configuration, the request should contain the IPN
notifications element.

[WARNING]
====
- Please note that configuring an IPN is not a Mandatory setup but
recommended.
- In case a notification address has changed, it is the responsibility
of the merchant
* to keep the address up to date
* to request a Firewall Change Request on the merchant's system so that
the firewall will accept the new address. The new notification addresses
can be called up at our <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.
- The IPN is using XML Digital Signatures, as defined here:
https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/
* The possibility of using this is already integrated in Java as
described here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/xmldsig/XMLDigitalSignature.html
* Oracle also provides a sample code in Java to validate a signed XML
here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/xmldsig/Validate.java
====


[NOTE]
====
In case there is no format specified in the request then the format
specified in the merchant configuration is used.
If there is no IPN format in the configuration, then NVP response is used for <<PP_RedirectUrlsIPNs, HPP/EPP requests>> or
application/xml for others by default.
Be aware that just *one* notification format can be set for all
notifications sent to the specified URLs.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Json]
==== Request a Notification in JSON Format

The following example shows how the {payment-gateway} can be
configured to send notifications as JSON format:

.Signed JSON Notifications
NOTE: To request an ``application/json-signed`` notification, switch the
format value. Compared to the default JSON notification, signed
notifications are base64 encoded and include a security signature: this
means you can verify that the notification comes from {payment-provider-name}, but need
to decode it before you can see its content.

``<notifications format="application/json>``


.XML Request (determines notification in JSON format)

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/generic_debit_notification__96ffdc.xml[]
----

The notification will look like this:

.JSON Notification

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Json_JSON_Notification.json[]
----

.application/JSON-signed Notification Example
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Json_applicationJSONSignedNotificationExample.json[]
----

.Verifying the Notification Signature

To verify a signed notification, check the signature data against the
Secret Key you received during merchant configuration:

[source,java]
----
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter;

...

private String merchantSecretKey = "merchantSecretKey";

public boolean isValidSignature(String responseBase64, String responseBase64Signature, String responseSignatureAlgorithm) throws Exception {
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(responseSignatureAlgorithm);
    mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(merchantSecretKey.getBytes("UTF-8"), responseSignatureAlgorithm));
    return responseBase64Signature != null && responseBase64Signature.equals(DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(mac.doFinal(responseBase64.getBytes("UTF-8"))));
}

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Xml]
==== Request a Notification in XML Format

``<notifications format="application/xml">``


.Notification in XML Format
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/xml/creditcard_purchase_notification_.xml[]
----

It is possible to set up conditional notifications based on the state of
the transaction.  For example, it is possible to instruct a notification
to only occur on 'failed' or 'successful' transactions.

[cols="10,10,10,10,50"]
|===
|Notification Type  | Notification Tag in Request     | Possible Extensions of URL  | Ports         | Possible Extensions of ``transaction-state``

|HTTP(S)            | ``URL``, ``transaction-state``  | any configured URL          | 80, 443, 5500 | if _URL_ <> empty and _`transaction-state`_ = empty all notifications go to that URL or if _URL_ <> empty and _`transaction-state`_ <> empty depending on the _transaction-state_ (success, failed, in-progress, etc) the notification goes to the corresponding _URL_.
|SMTP               | ``URL``, ``transaction-state``  |                             |               | if _URL_ <> empty and ``transaction-state`` = empty all notifications go to that URL (Email address prefixed with 'mailto'). OR if _URL_ <> empty and ``transaction-state`` <> empty depending on the ``transaction-state`` (success, failed, in-progress, etc) the notification goes to the corresponding _URL_ (Email address prefixed with 'mailto').

A request, which defines a URL to be used, when the payment process will fail:

.XML Request with different URL for failed transactions

----


.Alternative Payment Methods
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]

NOTE: Note that the "amount" value for some alternative payment notifications
contains 6 minor digits.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Content]
=== Notification Content

The content of the notification depends on the status of the response
{payment-gateway} receives from the provider.

|===
|{payment-gateway-abbr} receives... |{payment-gateway-abbr} sends notification:...

|a successful response
|_Success_ <<StatusCodes, Return Code and Transaction Status>>

|a failure response
|_Failure_ <<StatusCodes, Return Code and Transaction Status>>

|a timeout from provider |_Failure_ with error code (e.g. 500.1051)

|no info from provider |_Failure_ with error code 500.1052, if {payment-gateway-abbr} runs
in its internal timeout
|===

Credit Card IPNs are not encoded and non Credit Card IPNs are mostly
Base64 encoded, but there are variations possible. The variations depend
on the payment methods.

For each notification type it is possible to add more than one
recipient. Copy the tag and add a different URL.

// In the following example, the transaction will notify the merchant's
// site for a failed transaction and send all results to an email address.


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Transaction]
==== Notification Transaction Type

Depending on the selected payment method, the transaction type in the notification may differ from the one sent in the request. For example, a _pending-debit_ request may result in a _debit-return_ notification, or an _authorization_ request may result in a _deposit_ notification. +

NOTE: Credit card transactions: The ``transaction-id`` indicates which request/response and notification belong together. +
Alternative payment method transactions: Compare the ``transaction-id`` of the response with the ``parent-transaction-id`` of the notification.


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Delay]
=== Notification Delay

In some cases the {payment-gateway} ({payment-gateway-abbr}) may send a delayed
IPN.

This may occur due to one of the following reasons:

- Some payment method providers have longer processing periods than
others
- Communication delays caused by:
* downtime of the provider's system
* a workflow which has a fixed waiting time, at the {payment-gateway} as well as the provider.
* the merchant has sent an incorrect ID. In that case {payment-gateway} will send a 404 message, stating that the transaction is not
available.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Firewall]
=== Firewall Rules
 
To receive IPNs, ensure that your firewall settings allow a connection between the {payment-gateway} and your server. 

Add the following {payment-gateway} IP addresses to your firewall rules:

----

185.60.56.0/22
195.93.244.0/23
----

The IP-address from which you receive your IPN depends on your specific configuration.
