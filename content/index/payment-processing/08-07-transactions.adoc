[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction]
=== Referencing a Transaction

With the {payment-gateway} a payment process can reference two
subsequent transactions.

This reference can be accomplished in two different ways:

- For 
alternative payment methods (such as _PayPal_ and _SEPA_) and
_credit card_ the merchant can reference transactions via the
transaction ID.
- For _credit card_ payments the merchant can also
 <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization, use a token>>.

//-

[NOTE]
====
Referenced transactions (e.g. refund, <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring, recurring>>) have a limited transaction lifecycle. Starting on 1 February 2020, only transactions processed within the last two years can be referenced.
====

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction_byID]
==== Referencing by Transaction ID

Referencing by transaction ID uses the field <``parent-transaction-id``>.

In that case the <``transaction-id``> of the preceding transaction will be
referenced as the <``parent-transaction-id``> of the follow up transaction.

Be aware that the ``parent-transaction-id`` is also referred to as
``reference-transaction-id``.

The following example for PayPal shows the use of
<``parent-transaction-id``>:

|etc |void-authorization |6789012 |8901235

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring]
=== Recurring Transaction

A recurring transaction is a repetitive set of transactions. In general
the recurrence occurs on a regular basis (e.g. paying annual fees for an
insurance). A <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction, reference to such a transaction>>
always means that the subsequent transaction has
a functional dependency on the preceding transaction.

This could be, for example, a repeating transaction in a standard
transaction workflow which occurs on a regular schedule.

To submit a recurring transaction, the merchant must submit a request
with a specific transaction type. It depends on the payment method,
which transaction types apply. Currently the {payment-gateway}
supports recurring transactions with the payment methods <<CreditCard, Credit Card>>
, <<API_PaymentMethods_PayPal, PayPal>>, and <<SEPA>>.
If the merchant wants to use recurring transactions, the request must
provide the corresponding PERIODIC TYPE and a SEQUENCE TYPE.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Periodic]
==== The Periodic Type

The *PERIODIC TYPE* element is chosen specifically by the merchant and
depends on the merchant's business model. One of the following two
periodic types must be chosen:

- *_installment_*: one in a set that completes a financial transaction
and
- *_recurring_*: one in a set that occurs repeatedly, such as a
subscription.

//-

Both transactions will be processed the same way.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Sequence]
==== The Sequence Type

Additionally, the sub-element *SEQUENCE TYPE* with one of the following
sequences must be submitted:

- *_first_*: The first transaction in a series of recurring transactions
- *_recurring_*: A transaction that is part of a series of recurring
transactions.
- *_final_*: The final transaction in a series of recurring
transactions. A payment with this sequence type completes a chain of
recurring payments.

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Restrictions]
==== Restrictions

To ensure proper processing, please take into consideration the
following restrictions:

- _Recurring_ and _final_ transactions are required to be matched to
the _first_ transaction.
- A request with sequence type _first_ may only contain a
parent-transaction ID referring to another transaction which has been
submitted without a periodic type.
- A _recurring_ or _final_ transaction may only be referenced to a
parent _first_ if it is on status SUCCESS.
- Where a _first_ transaction has been voided, a
subsequent _recurring_ or _final_ transaction will not be accepted.
- After a transaction with sequence type _final_ has been submitted, it
is not possible to submit another _recurring_ or _final_ transaction for
this series.
- Only one periodic type may be used for the complete series of
recurring payments. This means that the periodic type in a subsequent
transaction must match the periodic type sent in the _first_ request.

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction]
=== Retrieve a Transaction

The {payment-gateway} allows the merchant to submit payment
transactions, as well as search for payments and merchant data. 

In the standard process, the merchant is informed via <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, IPN>>
about the status of a submitted transaction. _Retrieve Transaction_ is
an option for the merchant to find out the status of a transaction, if,
for some reason, the IPN has not been received. Lacking an IPN can
happen due to the fact that the transaction has not reached its final
status or additional information from providers are not present at the
point of time the _Retrieve_ query was sent. So in case the notification
was sent the status is final.

There are <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Delay, several reasons>>
why _Retrieve Transaction_ shall not be launched immediately
after submitting a transaction and still waiting for the IPN.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID]
==== Retrieve Transaction by Transaction-ID

Retrieving a transaction using a _Transaction-ID_ returns a single
transaction belonging to a merchant account. The _Transaction-ID_
attribute must match the value that was included in the transaction
response sent by {payment-provider-name}. An error occurs if the _Transaction-ID_ is
not available (request must be submitted later again) or the requested
user is not authorized to see the content. The desired content type can
be set through the _Accept_-header or by specifying an extension.

The <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Notification file (IPN)>> the merchant gets (based on configuration), is the standard
process to gather information about a submitted transaction. The reason
for this is that it could happen that the transaction has not reached
final status or additional information from providers are not present at
the point of time the _Retrieve_ query was sent. So in case the
notification was sent the status is final.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID_Response]
.Response when retrieving a transaction

The response corresponds to the transaction type of the transaction
being retrieved. For example, the transaction type = 'purchase' and the
transaction type = 'tokenize' have different responses when the
transaction is being created and that same response will occur for this
retrieval. See the sample responses as described for each transaction
type.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestID]
==== Retrieve Transaction by Request-ID

Retrieving a transaction using a Request-ID returns a single transaction
belonging to a Merchant Account. The request-id attribute must match a
request-id that was submitted during the creation of a transaction. An
error is returned if the request-id is not available or the user is not
authorized to see the content. The desired content type can be set
through the "Accept"-header with value "*application/xml*" or by
specifying an extension.

The behavior of a response is the same no matter whether you receive it
for a transaction by _Request-ID_ or Transaction-ID.

<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Transaction-ID>>.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestIDCategory]
==== Retrieve Transaction by Request-ID and Category

Retrieving a transaction using a Request-ID and Category returns a
single transaction belonging to a Super Merchant Account with resolving
category. The request-id attribute must match a request-id that was
submitted during the creation of a transaction with Super Merchant. An
error is returned if the request-id is not available or the user is not
authorized to see the content. The desired content type can be set
through the "Accept"-header with value "*application/xml*" or by
specifying an extension.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Storing]
=== Storing Additional Data

In addition to processing transactions, {payment-gateway} also
permits the storage and later retrieval of additional information.

The use of  the header "custom-field" permits the client application to
store key-value pairs with each transaction.


In the following example, the client application has stored a _purchase order_,
_invoice_, _crm-id_, _customer-tier_ and _promotional-code_.

This information is also echoed back in any response querying the status
of a transaction.  It is also possible to see this information in the
reporting system.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_View]
=== View Transactions in Browser

You can check your transactions in the browser. All you need is the
following URL:

``\https://\{hostname}/engine/rest/merchants/\{merchant-account-id}/payments/search?payment.request-id=\{request-id}``

Enter this URL in your browser and replace the following variables:

- {hostname}:
* if test environment: \http://{test-instance-hostname}
* if production environment: \http://{instance-hostname}
- {merchant-account-id}: Use the appropriate Test Merchant Account ID
- {request-id}: Use the appropriate Request ID

//-

When you login with the username and password of the test account, you
can see the result of the transaction in your browser.


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_TransactionTypes]
=== Transaction Types


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_CheckSignatureAuthorization]
==== _check-signature/authorization_

_check-signature_ and its related transaction types are transaction
types that are dependent on the payment method not of elementary need for
processing via {payment-gateway}. Some payment methods just
provide the possibility to verify if this payment method is allowed to
process by this consumer account or to verify if the account data are
valid. In _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ both Transaction Types are visible.   

[NOTE]
====
.Example
For <<Sofort>> the transaction type _check-signature_ can be submitted to validate the
digital signature.
====

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_GetUrlPendingDebitCredit]
==== _get-url/pending-debit/pending-credit_

_get-url_ and its related transaction types are transaction types that
depend on the payment method of elementary need for processing via
{payment-gateway}. Because of that for some payment methods
they are additionally created automatically even they were not sent via
the integration option. In _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ these Transaction Types are visible.

[NOTE]
====
.Example
For <<SEPADirectDebit, SEPA Direct Debit>> the transaction type _pending-credit_ is created in
addtion to the _credit_ that was submitted to visualize the process
steps.

- submitted _credit_ => visible in _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ _pending-credit_ and _credit_
- submitted _debit_ => visible in _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ _pending-debit_ and _debit_
====


[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_AutoSale]
==== _auto-sale_

_auto-sale_ is a pseudo transaction type, which has been created for the
purpose of offering merchants and easier way to integrate the standard
and most widely used "SALE" transactions. _auto-sale_ does not exist as
an individual transaction type. It is only a place-holder which is used
by the {payment-gateway} to decide which transaction type
should be used for a specific transaction. When using _auto-sale_,
the merchant is not required to send a specific transaction-type for
each credit card or alternative payment method request.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_AutoSale_BasicConfiguration]
.Basic Configuration

A merchant is automatically configured to use the default settings for
_auto-sale_.

The {payment-gateway} has already configured a default
transaction type for _auto-sale_ per payment method. The default values
are:

- For credit card, _auto-sale_ corresponds to  _purchase._
- For Multibanco, _auto-sale_ corresponds to _pending-debit_.
- For all other alternative payment methods, _auto-sale_ corresponds to
_debit._

//-

If a merchant sends in a transaction with transaction type _auto-sale_,
these default values will be used.

The transaction type stored in the database for a transaction request
will not be stored as _auto-sale_, meaning the response to a payment
request will include the actual transaction type and not _auto-sale_. It
will be stored with the transaction type configured behind _auto-sale_.
For example, a credit card transaction will be stored with transaction
type _purchase_.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_AutoSale_ExtendedConfiguration]
.Extended Configuration

A merchant may override these default transaction types by configuring
their own default transaction types. Each payment method may be
configured individually for _auto-sale_.

This is configured in the merchant account setup. For example, a
merchant may specify that for credit card, _auto-sale_ shall correspond
to _authorization_. This will override the automatically set
correspondence of _auto-sale_ to _purchase_.

Please contact Merchant Support to setup an extended configuration.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_AutoSale_Currency]
.Currency Configuration

In addition to transaction type, _auto-sale_ may also be configured for
a specific currency. The merchant is able to have multi default
transaction types depending on the currency.

.Example

``Merchant-id-1``, ``Creditcard``, ``EUR``, ``authorization``;
``Merchant-id-1``, ``Creditcard``, ``CZK``, ``purchase``;
``Merchant-id-1``, ``Creditcard``, ``GBP``, ``authorization-only``;
