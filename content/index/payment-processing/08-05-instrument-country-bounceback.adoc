== Instrument Country Bounceback

*Since 2015 the new VAT rules raised by the EU are applicable for
companies established in a EU member state and supply
telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services in the
e-commerce business. The company must charge the VAT of the EU country
the consumer belongs to.*

The bounce back feature can be used by transmitting the two-digit
country code via:

*``<instrument-country></instrument-country>``*

It is available for the following payment methods:

- Credit Card
- SEPA Direct Debit
- Paypal

The feature was implemented to support digital merchants to handle the
new VAT rules raised by the EU in a more efficient way.

It can be enabled if a merchant intends to catch this information in the
XML response.
