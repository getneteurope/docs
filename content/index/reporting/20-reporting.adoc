[#Reporting_DataReconciliation]
=== Data Reconciliation

The purpose of reconciliation is to compare transaction records and
verify that payments have been processed correctly. By reconciling
transaction information regularly, merchants will gain a better
understanding of their business transaction life cycle - from initial
authorization, to settlements, transaction disputes (returns), and
refunds.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_PaymentMethods]
[discrete]
==== Available Payment Methods

Reconciliation is currently available for <<API_PM_APM, alternative
payment methods>> (i.e. all payment methods but credit card) within {payment-gateway}.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_Process]
[discrete]
==== Reconciliation Process

The reconciliation files must be downloaded from an SFTP server on the
{payment-gateway}. The download process is described in
<<Reporting_DataReconciliation_FileDownload, File Download>>. Although it is
possible to download files manually, we recommend to automate the
process for the sake of consistency and convenience. Likewise, it is
recommended to run a program to facilitate the reconciliation process of
the downloaded files. The program used must be able to handle the CSV
file format.

To reconcile your transactions, compare the reference transaction
ID in the reconciliation file with a transaction ID that is already
available in your system. You will be able to see if another transaction
has been created updating the current status of your payment. Should you
notice inexplicable discrepancies between the reconciled data and your
records that you cannot resolve internally, please contact
<<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_Files]
[discrete]
==== Reconciliation Files

The {payment-gateway} generates transaction reports which are very similar
to a typical bank account statement. Merchants are recommended to match
and reconcile these report files regularly (daily) with the data
recorded in their system. When matching transaction data it is important
to remember how the payment total is calculated and also that the data
does not represent a complete payment history but only the account
activities that have been recorded over the previous 24 hours.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_Formats]
[discrete]
===== Formats

The {payment-gateway} is configured to generate daily transaction reports
containing sequential data sets for each of your transaction requests
processed by the system. These records are called reconciliation files
and are saved in CSV format on the Getnet SFTP server. When opened and
read in a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel, the data entries
are divided in columns and rows. Opened as plain text in any standard
text editor program, however, the field entries are separated by a
semicolon (``;``).

The files contain transaction data processed over the previous 24 hours.
They do not present a complete payment flow per payment (from
authorization, to settlement with possible rejections and disputes) but
only those transactions which have been processed by the {payment-gateway}
within the time period for which the report has been created.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_NamingConventions]
[discrete]
===== Naming Conventions

The reconciliation files are stored on the Getnet server in the
following format:

``<identifier>_<ip>_<date>_<merchant account id>.csv``

where

- ``<identifier>`` identifies the processing gateway
- ``<ip>`` is an internal Getnet IP address
- ``<date>`` is a time stamp represented as ``YYYYMMDD`` (year, month, day). It
shows the exact file generation date.
- ``<Merchant Account ID>`` is a 36 character identifier specifying your
business uniquely in the {payment-gateway}.
- ``.csv`` is the file extension denoting the format **C**omma **Se**parated **V**alue.

//-

Transactions processed on the {payment-gateway} are recorded in a
file named ``EngineAPTransactions.csv``. This file encompasses all
transaction types for the alternative payments currently available in
the {payment-gateway} processed over the previous 24 hours
(currently ``get-url``, ``check-signature``, ``pending-debit``, ``pending-credit``,
``credit``, ``debit``, ``deposit``, ``credit return``, and ``debit return``).

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_Structure]
[discrete]
===== Structure and Attributes for Alternative Payments

The file ``EngineAPTransactions*.csv`` currently comprises transfer transaction requests for the
<<PaymentMethods, alternative payment methods>> that have been
posted or modified by the system over the past 24 hours. If a column
does not apply to a payment method, the column will contain ``NULL``. The
data is recorded in the following columns/fields:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Field                           | Description

| MERCHANT ACCOUNT NAME           | The name of the merchant in the WebService Interface
| MERCHANT ACCOUNT ID             | The Merchant Account ID. This is a unique 36-digit number defining the merchant account.
| REQUEST ID                      | This is the identification number of the request identifying the transaction in the merchant’s system. It is unique for each request.
| PAYMENT METHOD                  | This is the name of the payment method that was processed via {payment-gateway}.

| TRANSACTION REASON DESCRIPTION  | A reason description (e.g. File generation was performed successfully). See also <<StatusCodes, Transaction Statuses>>.
| TRANSACTION AMOUNT              | The amount of the original transaction presented with decimal point and two decimal places (example: ``411.40`` or ``7.88``).
| TRANSACTION CURRENCY            | The currency of the original transaction.
| SETTLEMENT AMOUNT               | The amount credited to the merchant account.
| SUM SETTLEMENT AMOUNT           | The total sum of credit and debit type transactions that were booked on the account within one summary booking.
| SETTLEMENT CURRENCY             | The http://id3.org/ISO%204217[ISO 4217] currency code of the credited amount.

[NOTE]
====
If a merchant uses the Merchant Portal in combination with the data reconciliation files, there may be a timezone discrepancy.

The timezone for the data reconciliation file is UTC.

The timezone in the Merchant Portal is configurable. The timezone is automatically taken
from the user’s device (laptop, desktop, etc.). If there is a
difference, please adjust the timezone in the Merchant Portal to UTC.

within the reconciliation file also displayed with a spreadsheet application.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_UnmatchedTransactions]
[discrete]
===== Unmatched Payment/Transactions

If any of the transaction types deposit, debit-return or credit-return
enters the {payment-gateway} and cannot be matched to an existing payment,
this transaction is created as unmatched transaction. It appears in the reconciliation file without a reference
transaction ID.

If this unmatched transaction is manually matched to an existing
payment on the same day as it has entered the {payment-gateway}, it
appears as a transaction within the payment to which it has been matched. There will be *no record of an unmatched payment* in the reconciliation
file.

If, however, this *unmatched* transaction is manually matched to an
existing payment more than a day after it has entered the {payment-gateway}, it will *not* appear in the reconciliation file.
If it appeared in the reconciliation file, there would be two entries in
the reconciliation file for one transaction referring to two different
payments, thereby resulting in a duplicate.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_FileDownload]
[discrete]
==== File Download

NOTE: Although manual downloads are possible, we recommend to use an
automated process.

To be able to connect to the Getnet SFTP server you must have an SFTP
client and an internet connection supporting SSH-2 and the necessary
network security policies.

Please contact your system administrator to ensure that SFTP traffic is
permitted from your machine.

NOTE: Reconciliation files older than three months will be moved from
the Getnet SFTP server to external storage and will no longer be
accessible to the merchant. +
Therefore we recommend that the merchant always saves downloaded
files to avoid any missing information.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_Windows]
[discrete]
===== Windows

In a Windows environment, the reconciliation files can be downloaded
using any graphical SFTP application (like WinSCP) or command line SFTP
download.

To download files with a graphical application, enter the host name
``sftp.getneteurope.com`` and your username and password.
If you do not know your personalized access information,
please contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_UnixMacOS]
[discrete]
===== Unix or MacOS

You may also use a command line SFTP download from a Unix workstation or
MacOS.

To connect to your location on the Getnet host server
(``sftp.getneteurope.com``), enter:

-----
sftp username@sftp.getneteurope.com
-----

followed by the password when prompted.

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_FileDirectory]
[discrete]
===== File Directory

When you log on, you are automatically connected by username/customer
number/partner number (e.g. ``C0001`` or ``P0001``) to your file repository. In
the root window of the remote SFTP server site (Getnet server) you see the following subdirectories:

image:images/10-reporting/file-download-directory.png[SFTP Directory Structure]

[#Reporting_DataReconciliation_RetrievingFile]
[discrete]
===== Retrieving File

. Open the folder to ``<customerName>``.
It contains three subfolders: ``error``, ``new``, and ``processed``.
The files are stored in the folder ``new``.
. Open the folder ``new``.
. Select the file or files of the time period you want to reconcile.
. Copy the desired CSV files to your local machine. We recommend
to automate the daily downloads. If you are using a graphical user
interface and you do not run an automated program, you can drag and drop
those files or copy and paste them.
. Reconcile the files using a program tailored to the CSV format.
. {payment-gateway} allows you to archive reconciled
report files on the file server for future reference. Therefore move the
files to the folder ``processed``. +
Be aware that it is at your discretion to use this file repository.
