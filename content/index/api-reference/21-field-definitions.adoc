[#APIRef_FieldDefs]
== Field Definitions

[#APIRef_FieldDefs_Name]
=== Name
The field name structure is based on the hierarchical relation between individual elements. +
_Example:_ ``order-items.order-item.article-number``

.XML Structure
[source, xml]
----
<payment>
    <order-items>
        <order-item>
            <article-number> </article-number>
        </order-item>
    </order-items>
</payment>
----

In the example, the parent element is ``order-items``, and its child ``order-item``. +
``order-item`` itself is also a parent element of its child ``article-number``. 
The hierarchies are separated by a dot ``.`` +
Attributes are indicated by an ``@``

[#APIRef_FieldDefs_Cardinality]
=== Cardinality

_Cardinality_ indicates if the field is necessary for the request to work. A field can be either *mandatory* (M) or *optional* (O):

- *Mandatory:* The field must be included in each request and must contain a valid value. Without this field, the request fails. +
- *Optional:* The field can, but does not have to be, included in a request. Including optional fields can have certain advantages which we list in the respective field description.

//-

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some fields can be mandatory for individual requests, depending on transaction type and payment scenario. We list them as *M/O.* See the field description for more information on the respective field's cardinality.
====

====

*Example*:``merchant-account-id`` is listed as *M/O.*

Some transactions require a ``merchant-account-id``, others a ``merchant-account-resolver-category``. These two fields shall be used complementary, depending on the context which is explained in the description field.

[#APIRef_FieldDefs_DataTypes]
=== Data Types
Data types define the input values that can be used for a field.


[cols="20,80"]
|===
|Data Type |Description

|String
|A combination of text and numbers which is arbitrary but finite in size. A subset of String values can be defined according to a pattern value, such as ``api-id``. The pattern is given in the Description column.

|Enumeration 
|A subset of String. Enumeration consists of a list of predefined values, e.g. the severity of a status, which can provide the predefined values ``warning``, ``error`` and ``information``.

|Boolean 
|Has one of two possible values (usually either ``true`` or ``false``).

|Date 
|Value taken from a calendar (e.g. the date of birth). +
Format (according to ISO 8601): ``{date-pattern}`` +
This pattern cannot be customized.

|Timestamp
|A moment in time defined by a system. +
Format (according to ISO 8601): ``{timestamp-pattern-utc}`` +
This pattern cannot be customized.

|Decimal
|A numeric value which has digits before and after the decimal point ``.`` +
Example: the amount of money in a specific currency (e.g. 138.53 EUR).

|Number
|A numeric value that has no decimal places, such as the expiration month of a credit card.

[#APIRef_FieldDefs_Size]
=== Size
_Size_ shows how many characters can be used for this field. We provide the maximum value so you can make sure the whole amount of characters is processed.

In general, the _{payment-gateway}_ allows all characters for each field, depending on the _Data Type_. 

If other rules apply to a field, they are stated in the _Description_ column.
