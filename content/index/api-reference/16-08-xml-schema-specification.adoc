== XML Schema Specification

*XSD (XML Schema Definition)*, a recommendation of the World Wide Web
Consortium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C[W3C]), specifies how to
formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML[XML]) document. It can be used by
programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can
check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed
in.
