[#API_PBBA_Integrate_BrandIntegrateWeb_ThePaymethod]
.The _Pay_ method - for Successful _Request To Pay_ Response

``merchantRequestToPayResponseObject.secureToken`` is a unique token that
identifies a _Request To Pay_. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

Mandatory (M), Optional (O) or conditional \(C).

.Example

<custom-field field-name=``zapp.out.BRN`` field-value=``FRPSXS``/>

``merchantRequestToPayResponseObject.retrievalTimeOutPeriod`` specifies the
time window from the generation of _PBBA_ ``Code/secureToken`` to the
expiry of _PBBA_ ``Code/secureToken``, this is used by the ``get status``
(<<API_PBBA_Integrate_BrandIntegrateWeb_TheNotifymethod, _Notify_ method>>)
polling engine. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

|custom-field/[@zapp.out.RtrvlExpiryTimeIntrvl] | |O |O |Number |  |The
retrieval is the time taken from when the consumer hits the _Merchant_

sent out to consumer. The popup component of the button shows the appropriate
popup, based on this flag. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

|custom-field/[@zapp.out.CookieStatus] |M |M |C |String |  |Cookie status for
_Payconnect_ services indicates, if the cookie is valid and active. Value can be

When a transaction is confirmed/declined by the consumer, merchants
receive a <<API_PaybyBankapp_Samples, payment notification>>.

If you want to use the _Notify_ method, you must map the _PBBA_
``merchantGetPaymentStatusObject`` elements to the
{payment-gateway}.

``merchantGetPaymentStatusObject.payConnectID`` is used in the _PayConnect_
