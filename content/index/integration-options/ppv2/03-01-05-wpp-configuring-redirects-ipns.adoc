=== Configuring the Redirect Pages 

During and after the payment process, the consumer is redirected to a
corresponding page (e.g. success page upon a successful payment). You
can set the URLs for 'successful', 'failed' and 'canceled' page
redirects. Each type of redirect must be defined on at least one level.
There are multiple ways of how you can do this:

. Default database URLs

The default values for redirect URLs are configured during account setup
(merchant configuration) and saved into the database. They are then loaded
from the database each time you send a payment request (which means you
do not have to send them in the request).

NOTE: If you need to change the default values,
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

[start=2]
. Specifying redirect URLs in the payment request

//-

WARNING: Any redirect URLs which are sent in a payment request override their
respective database defaults.

You can overwrite the default values by specifying the redirect links in
the payment request:

[%autowidth,cols="v,,,,v,"]
|===
 | Field (JSON)         | Required | Data Type | Size  | JSON Parent   | Description

e| success-redirect-url | N        | String    | 2000 e| payment ({ }) | The URL to which the consumer is redirected after a successful payment.
e| fail-redirect-url    | N        | String    | 2000 e| payment ({ }) | The URL to which the consumer is redirected after an unsuccessful payment.
e| cancel-redirect-url  | N        | String    | 2000 e| payment ({ }) | The URL to which the consumer is redirected after they cancel a payment.
|===

If you have no database defaults, you *must* include them in the
request. Certain payment methods also require a specific redirect field
(=> `redirect-url`) to be present in the request.


[#PPv2_ConfiguringRedirectsIPNs_RedirectPages_RedirectURL]
=== redirect-url field

`redirect-url` overrides the database defaults for successful, failed  and canceled redirects.

WARNING: Do not confuse this field with `payment-redirect-url`, which contains the payment URL.


`redirect-url` covers all redirection options, i.e. regardless of
whether the payment succeeds, fails or the consumer cancels, they are
redirected to the URL specified in `redirect-url`:

[%autowidth,cols="v,,,,v,"]
|===
 | Field (JSON) | Required | Data Type | Size | JSON Parent   | Description

e| redirect-url | N        | String    | 256 e| payment ({ }) | The URL to which the consumer is redirected after a successful, failed or canceled payment if there are no alternatives available.
|===

`redirect-url` is only used as a fallback if there is
no `success-redirect-url`, `cancel-redirect-url` or `fail-redirect-url` defined
in the database or request.


[#PPv2_ConfiguringRedirectsIPNs_RedirectPages_PendingRedirectURL]
=== pending-redirect-url field

Pending URL is a special variation of `success-redirect-url`. Certain
payment methods require additional processing: even if the initial
request is successful, the process is not complete yet.

In this specific situation, {payment-gateway} returns a
_pending-debit_ transaction type in the response: the payment is
processed, but its current state is not final. Since this is not the
final response, the consumer is redirected to the `pending-redirect-url`
instead of the usual `success-redirect-url`.

[%autowidth,cols="v,,,,v,"]
|===
 | Field (JSON)         | Required | Data Type | Size | JSON Parent   | Description

e| pending-redirect-url | N        | String    | 256  | payment ({ }) | The URL to which the consumer is redirected when the response returns a _pending_ transaction type.
|===


[#PPv2_ConfiguringRedirectsIPNs_RedirectPages_Recap]
=== Recap

There are 3 levels for each type (canceled, successful, failed) of redirection:

.  Redirect fields sent in the request
(`success-redirect-url`, `fail-redirect-url` or `cancel-redirect-url`).
.  The `redirect-url` field - covering all of the three options - used
as a fallback if the above is not defined.
.  The third level is defined in merchant configuration (database
default), set up during merchant configuration.

//-

`pending-redirect-url` does not fit into these categories since it is
a specific variation of the `success-redirect-url`. It is used when a
payment request is successfully registered, but the response returns
a _pending-xx_ transaction type, pending further processing (e.g.
the payment is finished at a later time, or there is a delay).

When the payment is processed, the consumer is redirected to
the `success-redirect-url` page. `pending-redirect-url` can be sent in
the request, or have a default value in the database like the others.

The order of precedence starts at the top, i.e. if the first level
redirects are not defined, the second level is checked. You need to
define at least one level for each redirect, e.g. if you have no
database defaults set, you must include the redirects in the request.

Successful, failed and canceled redirects all *POST* payment response data
to the redirection URL target.

Here is an example payment request with defined redirects. You can
substitute them for any of the redirects found here (or add more):

[#PPv2_ConfiguringRedirectsIPNs_IPNs]
== Configuring IPNs through Payment Page requests

NOTE: This is only an example of how to configure extra IPNs through a Payment Page
payment request. For information regarding automatic IPNs and other
configuration options head over <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, here>>.

You can set up additional IPNs by indicating them in a request. These
are sent only per request (payment) and are not saved in your merchant
configuration:
