[#PPv2_WhatIs]

{payment-page-v2} is an online checkout solution which
combines a highly customizable user interface with payment processing
for various payment methods.

Payment Page allows merchants to customize the visual representation of their
payment page while keeping an optimal payment flow. Payment Page is designed
to streamline integration so merchants can accept payments quickly.
Additionally, {payment-provider-name} hosts all sensitive data so merchants can focus
on their business instead of worrying about data security and PCI.

Merchants can easily modify the design of Payment Page through Payment Page
Designer, an intuitive web interface for customizing nearly every visual
element the consumer would see. As an added benefit, using Designer
requires no graphical design experience or coding - new payment pages
can be created in minutes!

[#PPv2_WhatDoes]
=== What Does It Do?

Payment Page provides an appealing user interface for {payment-gateway}

created through backend payment sessions which supply a live URL to the
payment page.

Customers are redirected to this URL where they submit the payment and
the Payment Page handles the processing automatically, for the benefit of both the
merchant & customer.
