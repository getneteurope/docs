== Pay by Link via API
Payment Page offers the option to configure the expiration time & date of a
payment URL (``payment-redirect-url``). By adding
the ``hyperlink-expiration-time-stamp`` field to a normal payment request,
you can set the time & date when the payment URL expires: This allows
for using such URLs in different scenarios than instant payment, e.g.
sending the payment URL as a part of a newsletter/email, MOTO (Mail
Order/Telephone Order) payments, etc.

*The maximum allowed value is one
month in the future*

NOTE: You can use Pay by Link via API with credit card payments or alternative payment
methods; both are supported.

Payment links with an expiration stamp redirect to a Hosted Payment
Page. You remain fully PCI SAQ-A compliant using these links.

[NOTE]
.To set the expiration stamp for a payment link:
====
Add the ``hyperlink-expiration-time-stamp`` field to the payment request
and set its value to the desired time & date.

customers to a different page than your database defaults (or you have
no defaults set). See

e.g. ``2018-06-22T10:15:30+01:00``.
* The latest date for the expiration stamp is one month from the initial
request creation.
