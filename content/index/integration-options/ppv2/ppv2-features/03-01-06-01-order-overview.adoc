== Order Overview

image::images/03-01-06-01-order-overview/ShoppingCartDetails_OrderOverview.jpg[float=right, width=350, Show Shopping Cart Details]

Providing shopping cart details within the payment page enhances your
customer experience because consumers are more likely to feel confident
with the purchase. {payment-page-v2-abbr} features an order overview, toggled on and off
using a single variable. Whereas most payment pages only show the order
total, but not the specific items, {payment-page-v2-abbr} offers both.

This helps with a number of situations merchants face:

* Avoiding abandoned shopping carts because customers are unsure what
they are paying for
* Postponed payments (concert reservations, football tickets, etc.),
where it is easy to forget what one ordered weeks or even months before
* Important & "quality of life" information (flight/train numbers, trip
time, etc.) and more

[NOTE]
.To enable order overview for a payment:
====
Add the ``order-overview`` field to the payment request and set its
value to ``true``.

//We should probably redesign this table, if we want to exclude this screenshot.
//A "half page column" doesn't make sense...

The default value for ``order-overview`` is ``false``. You can also enable
order overview as a theme option in Payment Page Designer.

=== Detailing Order Items

The above shows how to enable the order overview, but not how to record
the actual order items in the request.

See the examples below for NVP & JSON code samples for an order of 10
notebooks and 5 sets of colored pencils. All fields related to order
items are optional, so it is up to you which ones you include (or leave
out).
