== Order Overview

image::images/03-01-06-01-order-overview/ShoppingCartDetails_OrderOverview.jpg[float=right, width=350, Show Shopping Cart Details]

Providing shopping cart details within the payment page enhances your
customer experience because consumers are more likely to feel confident
with the purchase. Payment Page features an order overview, toggled on and off
using a single variable. Whereas most payment pages only show the order
total, but not the specific items, Payment Page offers both.

This helps with a number of situations merchants face:

* Avoiding abandoned shopping carts because customers are unsure what
they are paying for
* Postponed payments (concert reservations, football tickets, etc.),
where it is easy to forget what one ordered weeks or even months before
* Important & "quality of life" information (flight/train numbers, trip
time, etc.) and more

[NOTE]
.To enable order overview for a payment:
====
Add the ``order-overview`` field to the payment request and set its
value to ``true``.

//We should probably redesign this table, if we want to exclude this screenshot.
//A "half page column" doesn't make sense...

The default value for ``order-overview`` is ``false``. You can also enable
order overview as a theme option in Payment Page Designer.

=== Detailing Order Items

The above shows how to enable the order overview, but not how to record
the actual order items in the request.

See the examples below for JSON code sample for an order of 10
notebooks and 5 sets of colored pencils. All fields related to order
items are optional, so it is up to you which ones you include (or leave
out).
