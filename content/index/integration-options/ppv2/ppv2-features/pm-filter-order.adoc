[#PPv2_Features_OrderFilter]
== Order and Filter Payment Methods

This _Order and Filter_ option allows you to display the available payment methods in your preferred order. If you use this option, only the payment methods defined are displayed. All the other payment methods are ignored.

This option is available for all of our _{payment-page-v2}_ integration options:

* the <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP, _Hosted Payment Page_>> (HPP), 
* the <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP, _Embedded Payment Page_>> (EPP)  or
* the <<PPv2_Seamless, _Seamless_>> integration.

If you don't want to sort all of your payment methods manually, you have the option to use the asterisk ( * ) as a placeholder. 
Enter your preferred payment methods and then the asterisk, e.g. `["creditcard", "paypal", "*"]` +
