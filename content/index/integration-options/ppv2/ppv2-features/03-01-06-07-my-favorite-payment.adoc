== My Favorite Payment

My Favorite Payment allows you to streamline the payment process for
your returning consumers by using **card tokens** which are created
during each card payment. If you include a card token (from a previous
transaction) in any future payment request, the consumer only needs to
input their CVV instead of filling out the entire card form.

There is also an option to use a different card: Consumers can switch
between the two options freely without leaving the session.

=== How does it work?
Card information is tokenized and returned as the ''token-id'' field in
the response automatically during a card payment.

Adding the ``token-id`` field with a token value from a previous payment
(e.g. ``"token-id":`` ``"4242796444090018"``) to the payment request
prepopulates the respective fields on the card form with the tokenized
information when payment page loads.
