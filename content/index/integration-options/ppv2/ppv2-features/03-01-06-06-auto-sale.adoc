== Auto-Sale
Auto-sale is a pseudo transaction type, which has been created for the
purpose of offering merchants and easier way to integrate the standard
and most widely used "SALE" transactions. Auto-sale does not exist as an
individual transaction type: it is only a place-holder which is used by
{payment-gateway} to decide which transaction type should be used
for a specific transaction. When using auto-sale, you are not required
to send a specific transaction-type for each credit card or alternative
payment method request.

[#PPv2_Features_AutoSale_BasicConfiguration]

=== Basic Configuration
Your merchant account is automatically configured for the default
``auto-sale`` settings. If you send a request with ``auto-sale`` as the transaction type, these
are the values used:

[cols=",", options="header"]
[%autowidth]
|===
|Payment method |Default transaction type
|``creditcard`` |``purchase``
|``ideal`` |``debit``
|``multibanco`` |``pending-debit``
|``paypal`` |``debit``
|``sepadirectdebit`` |``debit``
|``sofortbanking`` |``debit``
|===

However, the transaction is not registered as ``auto-sale`` in the database, but as the default transaction type. Look at example request
below:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/WPP_FeaturesAutoSaleBasicConfiguration.json[]
----

Although the ``transaction-type`` is ``auto-sale``, the request is actually
sent as ``purchase`` (or any other default value you set for credit card
payments). The behavior is the same for all payment methods.

[#PPv2_Features_AutoSale_ExtendedConfiguration]
[discrete]
=== Extended Configuration
You can reconfigure the default ``auto-sale`` settings for every payment
method upon request. As this requires changing your Merchant Account
configuration, you need to
contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>
for extended configuration options.

[#PPv2_Features_AutoSale_CurrencyConfiguration]
[discrete]
=== Currency Configuration
You can also configure ``auto-sale`` options for a specific currency. You
can have multiple default transaction types based on which currency is
used, e.g. credit card payments in EUR use ``authorization`` as the
default type, whereas USD payments are sent as ``purchase``. Again, this
is only possible by changing your Merchant Account configuration (contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>).
