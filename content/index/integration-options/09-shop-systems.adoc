== Shop Extensions

video::jO_86Hj0I60[youtube, width=640, height=360]

We offer you various shop extensions which you are able to
use *free-of-charge* to add payment functionality to your online shop
system. Therefore you only need to download/install our shop extension to
your online shop and to configure it to your needs.

Some shop systems refer to these shop extensions as "app", as
"add-on" or as "module". However, for the purpose of better legibility,
we call all of them "shop extensions" within this documentation.

All our shop extensions require *only PCI SAQ A* certification for credit
card payments which you may achieve very easily.

You are able to *test the shop extension* features and functionality via
pre-configured test accounts for each payment method. For going live you
need your personal credentials which you receive from Wirecard after
concluding a corresponding contract. Please contact our <<ContactUs, sales and support teams>>.

All our shop extensions are developed and offered as *open source* on link:https://github.com/wirecard[GitHub]. This means you are able
to use them free-of-charge, have full access to the source code and are
able to do forks, raise issues or do contributions.

Please have a look on
our <<ShopSystems_TermsOfUse, Terms of Use and Legal Notice>> before you use our shop extensions in your online
shop.

.Currently we offer shop extensions for the following shop systems:

the orders in your online shop.

recurring consumers of your online shop can easily and fast do their
