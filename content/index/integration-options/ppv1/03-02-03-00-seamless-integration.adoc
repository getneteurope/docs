Seamless integration provides a possibility to incorporate {payment-provider-name}'s payment form into the merchant's checkout page for merchants who want to

- avoid browser redirects to {payment-provider-name} Payment Pages and back to the
shop during the checkout process.
- take care of payment selection process and fully control the look and
feel of the payment form themselves.
- provide a more sophisticated checkout flow that includes
first collecting payment data and then allowing the consumer to review
the order one more time before confirming the payment.

This approach provides a seamless shopping experience for web-shoppers,
while the technical solution categorizes the merchant into the least
demanding PCI-DSS category. The main advantages of the Seamless solution
are:

- Seamless user experience - the payment form appears as an integral
part of merchant's checkout page.
- Possibility to decouple entering payment data from the actual payment -
it is possible to display a summary page in between.
- No in-browser redirects, no external processing pages, no pop-up
windows. The only redirect to an external page will happen if credit
card payment requires 3D-Secure verification.
- Only the simple Self-Assessment-Questionnaire "A" (_SAQ-A_) is required
for the merchant to be PCI-DSS compliant.
