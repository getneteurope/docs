[#PP_HPP_Introduction]
=== Introduction

The Hosted Payment Page (HPP) integration redirects the consumer from
the merchant's site to the payment page along with information about the
transaction and a secure digital signature.

The payment page integration requires the function call (along with
information about the transaction and a secure digital signature) of the
provided JavaScript library. The URL for the library varies depending on
the installation domain, i.e. ``\https://www.somedomain.com/engine/hpp/paymentPageLoader.js``

NOTE: Please contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>> for the exact URL.
