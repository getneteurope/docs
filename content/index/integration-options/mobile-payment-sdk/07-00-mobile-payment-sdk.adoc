[#MobilePaymentSDK_Introduction]

Mobile Payment SDK (MPSDK) is a lightweight user interface for the
{payment-gateway}.

MPSDK offers a seamless user experience by rendering a payment form as
if it's built in the merchant's mobile application.

This documentation was written for developers who will be integrating
MPSDK into their mobile application. On this page, you will find general
information you need to get started. For integration docs, refer to the
subpage <<MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup, Basic Setup and Integration>>.

A list of the currently supported payment methods can be found
in <<MobilePaymentSDK_PaymentMethods, Available Payment Methods>> below.

=== Available Payment Methods

We recommend using <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification>>, instead
of the default _MPSDK_ responses, as they are much more reliable.
