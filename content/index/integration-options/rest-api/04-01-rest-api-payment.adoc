[#RestApi_Payment]
== Create a Payment

Requests to the endpoints can be sent as XML, JSON.

- Content-Type header MUST be specified within the request as
"application/xml" or "application/json" to specify request body content.

- Accept header specifies response body format - "application/xml" or
"application/json". When Accept header is not specified in request then
application/xml is used by default and XML is returned back in response
regardless of request format.
//-

Structure and fields naming convention is based on payment.xsd so there
are the same field names used within JSON request/response as well as
within XML request/response.

NOTE: Payment requests taking longer than 30 seconds will be timed-out and
returned with an error.
