== REST API

The Payment Processing API conforms to the design principles of
**Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (REST). {payment-gateway}
provides access to resources (data entities) via URL paths. To use a REST
API, your application will make an HTTP request and parse the response.
By default, the response format is XML. If you wish, you can request
JSON instead of XML. Your methods will be the standard HTTP methods such
as GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

The API currently supports the following data formats:

- for *requests* XML, JSON.
- for *responses* XML, HTML or JSON. Some methods accept a subset of these
formats, only.
//-


Change the format extension to a request or set the HTTP accept
header to get results in the format of your choice. Methods to retrieve
data from the Payment Processing API require a ``GET`` request. Methods
that submit data require a ``POST``.

WARNING: API methods that require a particular HTTP method will return an error
if the request is not made using the correct method. The
following <<StatusCodes, HTTP Return Codes>> are helpful in analyzing the error.



Some API methods use optional or requisite parameters. Two things to
keep in mind when making requests with parameters:

- Parameter values should be UTF-8
- All URLs for REST should be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent_encoding[URL encoded].

Because the Payment Processing API is based on open standards, any web
development language may be used to access the API.

[#RestApi_Security]
=== Security

Every request sent to {payment-gateway} is
authorized and authenticated. Users are authenticated using
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[basic
authentication] over an SSL enabled channel. The Merchant Account
configuration is used to authorize the request.
