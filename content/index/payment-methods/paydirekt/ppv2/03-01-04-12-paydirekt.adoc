[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionTypes]
=== Transaction Types

With _paydirect_ you can use the transaction types <<PPv2_paydirekt_Samples_debitauth, _authorization_>> and <<PPv2_paydirekt_Samples_debitauth, _debit_>>.

A _debit_ charges the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account for a later transfer.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).

. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).

. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

.Optional fields

For a full list of optional fields, see the REST API
<<paydirekt, _paydirekt_ specification>>. Use the JSON structure of the _{payment-method-name}_ request below as a mapping reference.


[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionTypes_postprocess]
=== Post-Processing Operations

{payment-page-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the <<paydirekt_TransactionTypes, REST API paydirekt specification>> for details on _paydirekt_-specific post-processing operations.
