|authorization    | Performs a creditworthiness check at the moment when 
                    the consumer makes an order. All order items must be listed for the shopping basket. The authorization amount must match the value of the items in
                    the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentInstallment_Samples_Authorization, authorization samples>>

|capture-authorization | Used to capture the reserved funds at the moment
                         when some or all goods are physically delivered to the consumer.
                         Available only on successful authorization response which wasn't voided
                         nor fully captured. Partial (and multiple) capture is allowed, as long as
                         the authorization limit is not exceeded. Basket items only list the
                         items that were delivered to the consumer in this delivery, not the ones
                         that were delivered before or are waiting to be delivered. The total
                         amount of the capture must be the value of the items in the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentInstallment_Samples_CaptureAuthorization, capture-authorization samples>>

|void-authorization | Used when the consumer wishes to cancel some or all
                      (not yet shipped) items from the order. Available only for a successful
                      authorization response which was not yet voided or captured. Partial and
                      multiple void are allowed, until all items from the order are canceled
                      or shipped. Basket items only list those items which are canceled from the order.
                                | <<API_PaymentInstallment_Samples_VoidAuthorization, void-authorization samples>>

|refund-capture | Used when the consumer wishes to return some or all
                  delivered goods. Available on a successful capture-authorization.
                  Partial and multiple refunds are allowed, until all delivered items have
                  been returned. Basket items list only those items which are returned to the merchant.
                                | <<API_PaymentInstallment_Samples_RefundCapture, refund-capture samples>>

|credit | Used when the merchant wishes to grant a discount on an existing order. Items from this order may already be delivered to the consumer.
          Available on a successful capture-authorization. Multiple credits are
          allowed, but the overall sum of credits must not exceed the value of the goods delivered to the consumer. The credit transaction must include a
          basket item representing the discount. The credit transaction must refer
          to the successful authorization ``transaction-id``.

[#API_PaymentInstallment_Features_BasketItemsDetails]
==== Basket Items Details

Basket items details must be <<API_PaymentInstallment_Fields_OrderItems, sent with every request>>. Content of
the shopping basket depends on the location of the items.
There can be 3 different locations:

or credited depending to the transaction type.

The detailed items of the shopping basket are stored as a part of
payment details on provider and they can be obtained from _{payment-gateway}_ later as part of transaction details.
