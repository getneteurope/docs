[#Bancontact_TransactionTypes]
=== Transaction Types

_Bancontact_ _refund_ and _recurring_ transactions are not provided by _Bancontact_ directly. They can be accomplished using the payment
method _SEPA_. See refund and recurring for details.

For <<Glossary_TransactionType, transaction type>> details which are not given here, look at <<AppendixB,  Transaction Types>>.

When using our testing environment, the {payment-gateway}
does not send the request to _Bancontact_ servers. Instead, it
will be sent to a simulation endpoint that looks similar to
the _Bancontact_ landing page.

It covers the most basic situations, such as:

- Success scenario
- User cancellation
- Invalid card data

//-

NOTE: The look and feel of the simulated landing page will not be regularly
updated which may lead to differences when comparing with real _Bancontact_ landing page.

You can skip the input fields _Card Number_ and _Expiry Date_ as our
testing endpoint is ignoring them. To simulate a specific scenario use
one of the options presented by field _Error code._

[#Bancontact_Workflow]

[#Bancontact_debit]
=== Workflow: _debit_

[#Bancontact_UsingReSTAPI]
==== Using ReST API

image::images/diagrams/bancontact_debit-rest-api.svg[Bancontact workflow debit using ReST API]

. Consumer wants to pay a product/service.
. Consumer selects payment method _Bancontact (BC)._
. {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects consumer from website to _Bancontact_ landing page ({payment-gateway-abbr} uses
the field ``payment-methods/payment-method/@url`` in the response).
. Consumer enters _Bancontact_ card data.
. Now two actions occur simultaneously:
.. Consumer is sent back to the shop via _Redirect URL_ informing them
of the status of the payment. The destination depends on the given
redirect URLs in the <<Bancontact_Sample_ReSTAPI, _debit_ Request (Successful)>> sample (provided in the
``success-redirect-url`` field).
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome to the
merchant. In order to receive server-to-server notifications, you have
to provide the URL of your endpoint in the <<Bancontact_Sample_ReSTAPI, _debit_ Request (Successful)>> sample that will process IPNs (provided in the
``notifications/notification/@url`` field).

//-

[#Bancontact_UsingPaymentPage]
==== Using Payment Page

image::images/11-05-bancontact/Bancontact_workflow_debit_paymentpage.png[Bancontact workflow debit using payment page]

. Consumer wants to pay a product/service.
. Merchant redirects consumer to Payment Page.
. Consumer selects payment method _Bancontact (BC)._
. Payment Page redirects the consumer to _Bancontact_ landing page ({payment-gateway-abbr} uses
the field ``payment_methods/payment_method/@url`` in the response).
. Consumer completes the payment.
. Now two actions occur simultaneously:
.. Consumer is sent back to the Payment Page via _Redirect URL_
informing them of the status of the payment. The destination depends on
the given redirect URLs in the Payment Page sample, <<Bancontact_Sample_PaymentPage, _debit_ Request>> (provided in the field ``success_redirect_url``).
.. Payment Page sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome to
the merchant. In order to receive server-to-server notifications, you
have to provide the URL of your endpoint in the Payment Page sample,
<<Bancontact_Sample_PaymentPage, _debit_ Request>> that will process IPNs (``notification_url``).

//-

[#Bancontact_refund]
==== _refund_

Although, BCMC does not support a native refund mechanism, the {payment-gateway} offers a solution by which you are able to move funds
to your consumer. {payment-gateway} employs the _SEPA Credit Transfer_ to wire funds back to consumer.

In order to initiate a _refund_ using _SEPA Credit Transfer,_ look at the
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment_Samples_Initial_RecurringSepa_Xml, SEPA Credit Request>> sample.

The workflow is as follows:

image::images/11-05-bancontact/Bancontact_workflow_creditrefund.png[Bancontact workflow using credit refund]

. Merchant receives a request for refund from the consumer.
. Merchant agrees on refund amount with the consumer to refund a
specific _debit_ transaction.
. Refund transaction.
. Merchant refunds by referencing the _credit_ to a previous _debit_ transaction; or
. Funds are transferred and consumer receives refund.

//-

Characteristics of this workflow are:

- The workflow is offline, so you have to wait a longer period for the outcome (it is a matter of a few days).
- _SEPA Credit Transfer_ must be referenced to a successful _debit_
transaction; the _Transaction ID_ is taken from the successful _debit_
notification.

//-

NOTE: The refund is not available immediately. You can initiate it 24 hours
after the initial _debit._

When making a _SEPA Credit Transfer_ request, keep in mind:

. You have to reference the successful _debit_ in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
. Bank account details like IBAN and BIC are not provided by you in
the request.

//-

[#Bancontact_recurring]
==== _recurring_

Although, BCMC does not support native mechanism for recurring
payments, the {payment-gateway} offers a solution by which you
are able to charge the consumer repeatedly. {payment-gateway}
employs _SEPA Direct Debit_ to withdraw funds from the consumer.

In order to initiate a _recurring_ transaction using <<SEPADirectDebit, _SEPA Direct Debit_>>,

- look at <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment, Cross-Payment Methods Referencing>> for an explanation on how to make recurring
transactions using _SEPA Direct Debit._
- look at the <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment_Samples_Initial_RecurringSepa_Xml, XML SEPA Direct Debit Request Recurring>> sample.

//-

For the characteristics of the workflow see <<Bancontact_refund, refund>> above.
These characteristics also apply for _recurring_ in combination with
_SEPA Direct Debit._

When making a _SEPA Direct Debit_ Request, keep in mind:

. You have to reference successful debit in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field.
. Bank account details like IBAN and BIC are not provided by you in
the request.
. You need a Mandate, which represents the consumer's consent of being
charged via _SEPA Direct Debit._
. You need to provide your <<SEPADirectDebit_Fields_SpecificFields_CreditorID, Creditor-ID>>
in each _SEPA Direct Debit_ request.
