{payment-provider-name} ensures that our merchants will stay PSD2 compliant without any additional change in the implementation process.

[#ApplePay_Introduction]
=== Introduction

_Apple Pay_ supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment
organisations, namely American Express, MasterCard and Visa. When using
_Apple Pay_ in a shop, restaurant or other retailer, the name, credit
card number and security code are not visible to others.

_Apple Pay_ can be set up easily, with the consumer adding their
credit or debit card linked to the iTunes Store to their account.

Transactions are authorized with a unique number which is used by the
device account number. Instead of the security code on the back of the
card, _Apple Pay_ generates a dynamic security code to guarantee the
security of every transaction.

In-app online shopping with the iPhone is at your fingertips. Consumers
can pay for physical goods and services including clothes, electronics,
health and beauty artifacts, tickets and much more with Touch ID. The
payment process is confirmed in a single touch. The consumer need not
enter any account, dispatch or invoicing information. The card data is
handled with confidentiality meaning online retailers will not be
granted access.


[#ApplePay_TestAccount]
=== Test Account

Since _Apple Pay_ is a proprietary service, you have to have an Apple
Merchant ID and a Certificate Signing Request (csr-file) available
before you can setup _Apple Pay_.

* If you already have an Apple Merchant ID, you only need a CSR file.
See <<ApplePay_Workflow_ExistingAppleMerchantAccount, Apple Merchant Account exists>>.
* If you do not have an Apple Merchant ID, you need both, an Apple
Merchant ID and a CSR file. Wirecard's
<<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> will generate an Apple
Merchant ID for you. See <<ApplePay_Workflow_NoAppleMerchantAccount, Apple Merchant Account does not exist>>.

You can find additional information in
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html[Apple's own documentation].

If you have any questions, feel free to contact our <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

After you've set up your accounts:

. https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-pay-sandbox/[Add a test card]
to the wallet app.

. Integrate paymentSDK into your application.

. Conduct testing.

. Add a live card to the Wallet app and switch the {payment-gateway} instance to production mode (do not forget to
use production credentials - _MAID/SK/AppleMerchantID/csr_).

|Apple Merchant ID
2+|The merchant needs an Apple Merchant ID (merchant identifier), which can be
generated in the Apple Developer Portal. For details see
"Create a merchant identifier" in
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay_requirements[Setting Up Apple Pay Requirements.]
Just as well, you may ask Wirecard's <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> to
generate an Apple Merchant ID for you, see
<<ApplePay_Workflow_NoAppleMerchantAccount, Apple Merchant ID does not exist>>.
|csr-file
2+|The merchant can use _Apple Pay_ only if the Apple Merchant ID is associated
with a Certificate Signing Request (csr-file). This csr-file is generated by
Wirecard's <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>, see
<<ApplePay_TestCredentials_GenerateaCsrFileviaAppleMerchantID, Generate a csr-file via Apple Merchant ID>>.

[NOTE]
===
Apple provides payment data in JSON format. This payment data can be
used as cryptogram value when using an iOS device. To use the cryptogram
value with ReST API the merchant must encode it to Base64.
