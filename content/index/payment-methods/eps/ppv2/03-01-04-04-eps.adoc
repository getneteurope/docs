[#PPv2_eps_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _eps_. Here you find all
the information necessary for integrating this payment method into
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page. 

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type
<<PPv2_eps_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>

[#PPv2_eps_About]
=== About _eps_

eps-Überweisung (**e**lectronic **p**ayment **s**tandard), _eps_ for short, is
an online payment method provided to consumers of Austrian banks. _eps_ utilizes
the established popular payment methods for online shopping in Austria. _eps_
is one of the most popular payment methods for online shopping in Austria.

The _eps_ e-payment standard is the interface between online payment
systems for irrevocable payments, adopted by online shops as well as
public authorities like E-Government.

Selecting a bank in a merchant's web store, the consumer is redirected
from the merchant's web store to their bank's online banking window.

If no bank is selected in the merchant's web store, the bank selection
is done during redirect and the consumer is redirected to their bank's
online banking window after selecting a bank from the SO (Scheme
Operator, central routing instance for eps) bank list.

Successfully logging on to their respective account using their account
number and PIN, the consumer needs to confirm the transaction using
a TAN.

After the consumer has confirmed the payment with TAN (or other commonly
used approval mechanism within internet banking), _eps_ confirms the
payment-sending payment result and details to the PSP system.

The consumer clicks the "Back to shop" link in the online banking window
and is redirected back to the merchant's web shop.

include::{root}/include/list-eps-banks.adoc[]

[#WPP_eps_giropay]
=== _giropay_ interoperability

SO-implemented interlink to _eps-giropay_ scheme in Germany.
If the merchant's contract allows to process those interoperability
transactions, all _eps-giropay_ participating banks in Germany can also be
reached with a technical _eps_ transaction. To enable _giropay_
interoperability, the merchant has to register _giropay_ directly with
_eps_. In some cases, this is a free add-on. If _giropay_ is activated by
_eps,_ the bank selection page shows the German bank institutes next to
the Austrian ones.

[#PPv2_eps_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the account holder's bank account with the
specified amount and transfers it immediately.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<PPv2_eps_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _eps_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
payment form.

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> 
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_eps_refund]
=== Transaction Type _refund_

Basically, _eps_ with {payment-page-v2-abbr} supports _debit_ only. For refunds,
use <<SEPACreditTransfer, SEPA Credit Transfer>> (if SEPA Credit Transfer is
activated for your merchant account) through our <<RestApi, REST API>>.

You must provide the necessary data:

- ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
debit. You can gather it from the response to a successful debit.
- ``amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund).

//-

If the ``parent-transaction-id`` is not available, the following fields
are mandatory:

- ``iban``
- ``bic`` (only required by some acquirers)
- ``amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund)
