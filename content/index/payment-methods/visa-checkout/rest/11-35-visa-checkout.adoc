=== Test Credentials

.Test Merchant Account
NOTE: There is no public merchant-account available. VCO can be enabled to a specific merchant, provided that they have
registered with VCO and agreed on VCO's Merchant Services Agreement.
This will generate a VCO external client ID which has to be provided to
{payment-gateway}. For merchants integrating directly to VCO to
extract wallet data then to {payment-gateway} for payments, the
API Key has to be additionally provided.
