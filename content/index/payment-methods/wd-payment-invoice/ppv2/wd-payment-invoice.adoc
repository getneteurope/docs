:payment-method-name: {payment-provider-name} Payment on Invoice

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice]
== {payment-page-v2}

With _{payment-provider-name} Payment on Invoice_, {payment-provider-name} guarantees that merchants receive the payment amount, even if the consumer does not pay.

The consumer pays by invoice upon receipt of the goods. {payment-provider-name} pays the merchant the order amount prior to settlement with the consumer. The invoicing and collection process (including dunning) is also handled by {payment-provider-name}.

This payment method is available for *German merchants* only.

_{payment-method-name}_ is a type of <<PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_OfflineBankTransfer, Offline Bank Transfer>>.

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_ProcessChain]
[WARNING]
====
To get the approval to go live, every merchant needs to complete a number of <<API_PaymentInvoice_ProcessChain, process chains>> in a test environment successfully. {payment-provider-name} checks and approves the frontend/checkout and invoices (if generated and sent out by the merchant).
====

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_TransactionType_authorization]
=== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account for a later transfer. For _{payment-provider-name} Payment on Invoice_, it also triggers a creditworthiness-check.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Sample Response URL)

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/PPv2GuaranteedInvoiceTransactionTypeAuthorizationRedirectURL.json[]
----

[%autowidth, cols="m,v,"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. 


[NOTE]
====
[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_ConsenttoGeneralTermsandConditions]
.Checkout

During checkout, the consumer has to agree to {payment-provider-name}'s general terms and conditions. They have to give their consent by ticking the
respective checkbox.


[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_AdditionalBusinessContitions]
.Additional Business Conditions

When consumers use _{payment-method-name},_
payments with debt discharging effect can be made solely to {payment-provider-name}.
====

_Possible transaction results_:

- Successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- Failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- Canceled (``transaction-state: failed``):The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the ``statuses`` object of the payment response. Canceled
payments are returned as ``failed``, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3^rd^ party provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.



.3. Parse and Process the Payment Response (Decoded Payment Response)

[source,json,subs=attributes+]

----
include::{root}/samples/json/PPv2GuaranteedInvoiceTransactionTypeAuthorizationResponse.json[]
----

[WARNING]
====
The response for each ``authorization`` request returns the field ``descriptor``, a unique alphanumerical code identifying the authorization. This ``descriptor`` must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by the merchant (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:
"Verwendungszweck").
====

In addition to the request fields, the response returns the following fields:

[%autowidth]
[cols="m,,,,"]

2+|field-value |Boolean a|

- ``true``: Consumer accepted the General Terms and Conditions.

3+|transaction-state |String a|The current transaction state.

only.
3+|completion-time-stamp |DateTime a|The UTC/ISO time-stamp documents the
time and date when the transaction was executed.

Format: ``YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`` (ISO).

.4+|status 2+m|code |String |Status code of the status message.

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_PostProcessingOperations]
=== Post-Processing Operations 
WPP is best used for one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _authorization_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a capturing of one of your _authorization_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<API_PaymentInvoice, {payment-method-name} specification>> for details on {payment-method-name}-specific post-processing operations.
