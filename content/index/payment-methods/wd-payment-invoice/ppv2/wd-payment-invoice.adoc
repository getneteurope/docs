:payment-method-name: Payment on Invoice

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice]
== {payment-page-v2}

With _Payment on Invoice_, Getnet guarantees that merchants receive the payment amount, even if the consumer does not pay.

The consumer pays by invoice upon receipt of the goods. Getnet pays the merchant the order amount prior to settlement with the consumer. The invoicing and collection process (including dunning) is also handled by Getnet.

This payment method is available for *German merchants* only.

_{payment-method-name}_ is a type of <<PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_OfflineBankTransfer, Offline Bank Transfer>>.

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_ProcessChain]
[WARNING]
====
To get the approval to go live, every merchant needs to complete a number of <<API_PaymentInvoice_ProcessChain, process chains>> in a test environment successfully. Getnet checks and approves the frontend/checkout and invoices (if generated and sent out by the merchant).
====

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_TransactionType_authorization]
=== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account for a later transfer. For _Payment on Invoice_, it also triggers a creditworthiness-check.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Sample Response URL)

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{root}/samples/json/PPv2GuaranteedInvoiceTransactionTypeAuthorizationRedirectURL.json[]
----

[%autowidth, cols="m,v,"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. 


[NOTE]
====
[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_ConsenttoGeneralTermsandConditions]
.Checkout

During checkout, the consumer has to agree to Getnet's general terms and conditions. They have to give their consent by ticking the
respective checkbox.


[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_AdditionalBusinessContitions]
.Additional Business Conditions

When consumers use _{payment-method-name},_
payments with debt discharging effect can be made solely to Getnet.
====

_Possible transaction results_:

- Successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- Failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- Canceled (``transaction-state: failed``):The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the ``statuses`` object of the payment response. Canceled
payments are returned as ``failed``, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3^rd^ party provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.



.3. Parse and Process the Payment Response (Decoded Payment Response)

[source,json,subs=attributes+]

----
include::{root}/samples/json/PPv2GuaranteedInvoiceTransactionTypeAuthorizationResponse.json[]
----

[WARNING]
====
The response for each ``authorization`` request returns the field ``descriptor``, a unique alphanumerical code identifying the authorization. This ``descriptor`` must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by the merchant (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:
"Verwendungszweck").
====

In addition to the request fields, the response returns the following fields:

[%autowidth]
[cols="m,,,,"]
|===
3+|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

3+|ip-address |String a|The internet protocol address of the account holder as
recorded by the entity receiving the transaction attempt from the account holder.

2+|field-value |Boolean a|

- ``true``: Consumer accepted the General Terms and Conditions.
- ``false``: Consumer did not accept the General Terms and Conditions.

3+|transaction-id |String |A unique identifier assigned to every transaction.
Used when searching for or referencing it later.
3+|transaction-state |String a|The current transaction state.

Possible values:

- ``in-progress``

//-

Typically, a transaction starts with state ``in-progress`` and finishes with
state either ``success`` or ``failed``. This information is returned in the response
only.
3+|completion-time-stamp |DateTime a|The UTC/ISO time-stamp documents the
time and date when the transaction was executed.

Format: ``YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`` (ISO).

.4+|status 2+m|code |String |Status code of the status message.

2+|description |String |The description of the transaction status message.

[#PPv2_PaymentInvoice_PostProcessingOperations]
=== Post-Processing Operations 
WPP is best used for one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _authorization_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a capturing of one of your _authorization_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<API_PaymentInvoice, {payment-method-name} specification>> for details on {payment-method-name}-specific post-processing operations.
