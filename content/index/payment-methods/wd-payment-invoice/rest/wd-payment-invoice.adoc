|authorization    | Performs a creditworthiness check at the moment when
                    consumer makes an order. All order items must be listed for the shopping
                    basket. The authorization amount must match the value of the items in
                    the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, _Guaranteed Payment on Invoice_ samples>>

|capture-authorization | Used to capture the reserved funds at the moment
                         when some or all goods are physically delivered to the consumer.
                         Available only on successful ``authorization`` response which wasn't voided
                         nor fully captured. Partial (and multiple) capture is allowed, until
                         the authorization limit is not exceeded. Basket items only lists the
                         items that were delivered to the consumer in this delivery, not the ones
                         that were delivered before or are waiting to be delivered. The total
                         amount of the capture must be the value of the items in the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, _Guaranteed Payment on Invoice_ samples>>

|void-authorization | Used when the consumer wishes to cancel some or all
                      (not yet shipped) items from the order. Available only for a successful
                      ``authorization`` response which was not yet voided or captured. Partial and
                      multiple void are allowed, until all items from the order are canceled
                      or shipped. Basket items only list those items which are being canceled from the order.
                                | <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, _Guaranteed Payment on Invoice_ samples>>

|refund-capture | Used when the consumer wishes to return some or all
                  delivered goods. Available on a successful ``capture-authorization``.
                  Partial and multiple refunds are allowed, until all delivered items have
                  been returned. Basket items list only those items which are being returned to the merchant.
                                | <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, _Guaranteed Payment on Invoice_ samples>>

|credit | Used when merchant wishes to grant a discount on an existing
          order. Items from this order may already be delivered to the consumer.
          Available on a successful ``capture-authorization``. Multiple credits are
          allowed, but the overall sum of credits may not exceed the value of the
          delivered goods to the consumer. The credit transaction must include a
          basket item representing the discount. The credit transaction must refer
          to the successful authorization transaction ID.
                                | <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, _Guaranteed Payment on Invoice_ samples>>

[NOTE]
====
. <<API_PaymentInvoice_BasketItemsDetails, Basket items>>  must be specified in every request.
. The response for each ``authorization`` request returns an individual
string (an alphanumerical code) in the
field ``descriptor``.
. The descriptor must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by
the shop (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:
"Verwendungszweck").­­
. ``capture-authorization`` transactions have to follow a successful
``authorization`` on the same day the goods are dispatched.
. The period between ``authorization`` and the first
``capture-authorization`` must be at least 4 hours.
. Merchants can request partial ``capture-authorizations`` if the goods
are shipped in separate shipments.

The shopping basket always contains the items that are being authorized
(ordered), captured (delivered), voided (canceled), refunded (returned)
or credited depending to the transaction type.

The detailed items of the shopping basket will be stored as a part of
payment details on provider and they can be obtained from {payment-gateway} later as part of transaction details.

[#API_PaymentInvoice_DeviceFingerprint_GuaranteedInvoice]
==== Device Fingerprint (Guaranteed Payment on Invoice)

[#API_PaymentInvoice_DeviceFingerprint_GuaranteedInvoice_Introduction]
===== Introduction

_Device Fingerprint (Guaranteed Payment on Invoice)_ is a method of fraud
protection and able to identify technical devices. Fraudsters learn to
exploit the weaknesses of traditional fraud prevention tools over time.
We protect businesses from fraud and loss of revenue with innovative
fraud prevention: by automatically linking transactions, fraud can be
detected in real time. With our self-learning and adaptive software you
are prepared to face new and upcoming fraud scenarios. This document
describes the procedure of a _Device Fingerprint_ call and how to
implement its result in the PAYMENT_QUERY operation and PAYMENT_REQUEST
operation.

[#API_PaymentInvoice_DeviceFingerprint_GuaranteedInvoice_UniqueToken]
===== Generate a Unique Token

To generate a fingerprint you first need to create a unique token within
your online shop. To ensure that the token is really unique, we suggest
using a combination of customer id and timestamp which is encrypted,
with MD5 for instance.

.Generate a unique token (Example)
[source,php]
----
$deviceIdentSId = 'WDWL';
$timestamp = microtime();
$customerId = $customerObject->getId();
$deviceIdentToken = md5($customerId . "_" . $timestamp);
----

[#API_PaymentInvoice_DeviceFingerprint_GuaranteedInvoice_RunJavaScript]
===== Run JavaScript

We recommend outputting the _Device Fingerprint_ JavaScript code as
early as possible to get a sufficient latency between script call and
end of the order.

For instance when the customer entered the checkout or when the customer
is putting a first item into the cart.

Please ensure that this script is executed only one-time per session
(per customer + checkout + device).

.Output Device Fingerprint JavaScript/HTML/PHP (Example)
[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script language="JavaScript">
 var di = {t:'<?php echo $deviceIdentToken ?>',v:'<?php echo $deviceIdentSId ?>',l:'Checkout'};
 </script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="//d.ratepay.com/<?php echo $deviceIdentSId ?>/di.js">
</script>
 <noscript><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//d.ratepay.com/di.css?t=<?php echo $deviceIdentToken ?>&v=<?php echo $deviceIdentSId ?>&l=Checkout">
</noscript>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="//d.ratepay.com/<?php echo $deviceIdentSId?>/c.swf" width="0" height="0">
<param name="movie" value="//d.ratepay.com/<?php echo $deviceIdentSId ?>/c.swf" />
<param name="flashvars" value="t=<?php echo $deviceIdentToken ?>&v=<?php echo $deviceIdentSId?>"/><param name="AllowScriptAccess" value="always"/>
</object>
----

[#API_PaymentInvoice_DeviceFingerprint_GuaranteedInvoice_DataTransferTo{payment-provider-name}]
===== Data Transfer to Getnet

Please transfer the ``deviceIdentToken`` within the authorization request to
Getnet. You can find a corresponding XML sample for either <<API_PaymentInvoice_Samples_GuaranteedInvoice, Guaranteed Payment on Invoice>> or <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Payment Guaranteed Direct Debit>>.

[#API_PaymentInvoice_RegularConsumers]
==== Regular Consumers

Regular consumers who pay their bills on time are important capital for
each merchant. With Getnet, merchants can use this capital as a
payment method.

To accomplish that, merchants submit a list with the order and
payment history of their consumers to Getnet.

https://wcdwl.ratepay.com/index.php/en/overview.html[Here] you can
find which format (and content) you need for the list and how to upload
it.

[#API_PaymentInvoice_ConsenttoGeneralTermsandConditions]
==== Consent to General Terms and Conditions

During checkout, the consumer has to agree to Getnet's general terms
and conditions. They have to give their consent by ticking an
appropriate checkbox.
