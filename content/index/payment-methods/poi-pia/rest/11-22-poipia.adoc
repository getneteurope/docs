bank account to the merchant's Wirecard Bank account.

[#API_POIPIA_Workflow_From_to_authorization]
===== _authorization_

If the request is successful, a response will be returned with the
status ``success``. This response means that the transaction has
entered {payment-gateway} successfully. The payment is in the
status ``pending`` and awaiting a _deposit_ transaction from the
consumer's bank account to the merchant's bank account.

If the request is not successful, a response will be returned with
status ``failed``. The response always contains a status code and a
description.

Please read the description of the ``failed`` status carefully as it will
help to understand why the transaction request has failed and what needs
to be fixed in order to send a successful transaction request.

[#API_POIPIA_Workflow_From_to_deposit]
===== _deposit_

Once the consumer's payment reaches the {payment-gateway},
{payment-gateway} matches the transaction to the original
_authorization_ transaction and creates a _deposit_ transaction.

[#API_POIPIA_Workflow_refund]
==== _refund_

Merchant can refund a _wiretransfer_ payment by sending a _SEPA credit_
transaction. It is possible to provide the ``transaction-id`` of the
corresponding _deposit_ transaction in the ``parent-transaction-id`` field
of the _refund_ request. For more details please refer to the chapter
<<SEPACreditTransfer, Credit Transfer (SEPA)>> and
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment, Cross-Payment-Methods Referencing>>.

It allows to perform a _refund_ to the corresponding buyer bank account
without sending the consumer's name and bank account details like IBAN
and BIC. This information is taken automatically from the {payment-gateway}. If the consumer's first/last name or IBAN/BIC is unknown for the
referenced _deposit_ transaction and not provided with the _credit_
request, the request will be rejected. If consumer's first and last name
and IBAN and BIC are sent with the _credit_ SEPA request, this information
will be used instead of the data stored in the referenced deposit
transaction.

If an amount is provided in the _credit_ request, this value will be
refunded. Multiple refunds are allowed. If no amount is provided, the
whole amount of the _deposit_ transaction will be refunded.

[#API_POIPIA_Workflow_void]
==== _void_

{payment-gateway} allows merchants to void _wiretransfer Authorization_ transactions.

NOTE: Voiding an _authorization_ transaction will not prevent the processing of incoming deposits for
this authorization. Furthermore it is possible to void an _authorization_ even if a _deposit_ has already been received for it.

To void an existing _wiretransfer authorization_ transaction, sending a
new transaction request with the type ``void-authorization`` request is
necessary. A request for a void transaction must contain
a ``parent-transaction-id`` referring to the _authorization_ transaction
that needs to be voided.

[#API_POIPIA_Fields]
=== Fields

The following elements are mandatory (M) or optional (O) for a
request/response.
