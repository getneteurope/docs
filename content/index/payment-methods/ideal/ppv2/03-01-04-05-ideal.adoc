[#PPv2_ideal_About]
=== About _iDEAL_

_iDEAL_ is an e-commerce payment method widely used in the Netherlands.

[#PPv2_ideal_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A debit transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

<<PPv2_ideal_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _iDEAL_ payments.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it's
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
payment form.

to every merchant account (by {payment-provider-name}).
3+|request-id |String |Mandatory |150 a|A unique identifier assigned to every request
(by merchant). Used when searching for or referencing it later.
``{{$guid}}`` serves as a placeholder for a random ``request-id``.

Allowed characters: [a-z0-9-_]
3+|transaction-type |String |Mandatory |n/a |The requested transaction type. For
_iDEAL_ payments, the transaction-type must be set to ``debit``.
.2+|requested-amount  2+e|value |Numeric |Mandatory |18.2 a|The full amount that is
requested/contested in a transaction. 2 decimal digits allowed.

Use . (decimal point) as the separator.

2+|currency |String |Mandatory |3 a|The currency of the requested/contested
transaction amount. For _iDEAL_ payments, the currency must be set to ``EUR``.

Format: 3-character abbreviation according to ISO 4217.

|payment-methods e|payment-method e|name |String |Mandatory | 15 |The name of the

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

include::{root}/samples/json/WPP_IdealTransactionTypeDebit_2RtCttPPIRU.json[]

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_ideal_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations

{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through {payment-page-v2-abbr} is not possible for _iDEAL_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
_SEPA Credit Transfer_. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_iDEAL_ specific post-processing operations.
