[#KlarnaV2_TestCredentials_NatRequirements]
==== National Input Requirements

For required input different markets have different standards. This is mainly due to the internal standards in a country. In the Nordics, for example, national identification numbers are commonly used, while in other countries titles are important.

Klarna needs as much information as possible for two reasons. 

* Klarna offers credit to consumers. For a proper assessment of risk and fraud, Klarna needs consumer data of high quality in a standardized format. 
* Klarna is part of the order management-process.

[#Klarnav2_reconciliation]
=== Settlement Reports - Reconciliation

_Klarna_ takes full credit and fraud risk and guarantees full payments.
However, there are 3 exceptions:

* _Klarna_ rejects the payment guarantee if you have violated the shipping policies.
* _Klarna_ rejects the payment guarantee in case of chargeback.
* In fraud cases where Klarna accepts the liability, _Klarna_ reduces the payout amount by the VAT.
//-

_Klarna_ records these occurences in settlement reports. Settlement reports explain in detail all payment flows between _Klarna_ and you, thus helping you to reconcile your accounts. Each settlement report is linked to a specific payout by the unique payment reference which appears on your bank account statement.

Settlement reports are collected in <<Reporting_DataReconciliation, reconciliation files>> that you can download and process.
