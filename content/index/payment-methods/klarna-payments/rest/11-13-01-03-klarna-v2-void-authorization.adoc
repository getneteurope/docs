[#KlarnaV2_TransactionTypes_voidAuthorization]
==== _void-authorization_

Use this transaction type to cancel an order, e.g. if the goods or services are not available
or the consumer wants to cancel their order. We recommend to cancel authorizations to avoid any influence on risk decisions for further payments.


You can cancel

* only authorized amounts that have not yet been completely captured.
* the **total order amount**.
* a **partial order amount**. If the order has been partially captured, a _void-authorization_ cancels only the part of the preceding _authorization_ that has not yet been captured.

//-

NOTE: Once canceled, you can no longer process the order. The initial authorization/reservation is no longer valid.

To refer to a specific _authorization_, _adjust-authorization_ or _pending-authorization_, you need the ``parent-transaction-id``, which is the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding transaction.

. -> Send a _void-authorization_ request. This request must contain the ``parent-transaction-id``. Enter the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_, _adjust-authorization_ or _pending-authorization_ that is to be canceled.
. _{payment-gateway}_ checks if parts of this order have already been captured:
  ** If yes: _{payment-gateway}_ sends a _void-authorization_ request for the uncaptured order items to _Klarna_. 
  ** If no: _{payment-gateway}_ sends a _void-authorization_ request for the total order amount to _Klarna_. 
. _Klarna_ approves or rejects the void request and returns the result.
. _{payment-gateway}_ sends you the _void-authorization_ response which contains the status code.
. -> Process the _void-authorization_ response.
