[#KlarnaV2_TransactionTypes_refundCapture]
==== _refund-capture_

Use this transaction type to trigger a refund if a consumer returns all or some items. 

You can refund

* the **total order amount:** If you do not send order items within the _refund-capture_ request, the total order amount will be refunded. 
* a **partial order amount:** Send the returned order items information within the _refund-capture_ request to trigger a partial order amount.

//-

You cannot 

* bundle refunds. You have to create a _refund-capture_ transaction for each _capture-authorization_ transaction separately.
* change the price of the ordered items, otherwise the _refund-capture_ transaction will be rejected.
//-

To refer to a specific _capture-authorization_, you need the ``parent-transaction-id``, which is the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _capture-authorization_ response.
