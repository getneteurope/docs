[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Introduction]

This section describes _Credit Card_ transaction types that can be used
with the {payment-gateway}. For each transaction type we
provide a _Credit Card_ specific introduction. We explain the transaction
type's availability and restrictions. We look at the conditions or
preconditions required to process this transaction type.

//The access data required to communicate with the endpoint are provided with the <<CreditCard_TestCredentials, test credentials>>.

You get the best knowledge of our transaction types when you send an XML
request to our endpoint. We describe the content and structure of these
requests in the section "Sending Data". For reference we also provide a
response that can be expected. Where applicable we set up a flow of
subsequent transaction types (e.g. _authorization_ > _capture-authorization_). Refer to the
<<CC_Fields, complete field list>> for credit card transactions.

In ``<statuses>`` of the response you will find a number that represents a <<StatusCodes, status code>>.

| [[CreditCard_TransactionTypesList_CaptureAuthorization]] <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization, _capture-authorization_>> 
 a| Takes funds from the cardholder's account. Must follow an _authorization_ or _authorization-supplementary_ chain.

Typically, a _capture-authorization_ captures either part of or the full authorized amount. If you want to capture an amount higher than initially authorized, your merchant account needs to be configured accordingly (details see <<CreditCard_Overcapturing, overcapturing>>).


| [[CreditCard_TransactionTypesList_CheckEnrollment]]
 <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure_CheckEnrollment,  _check-enrollment_>> | _check-enrollment_ consists of a single request/response communication that verifies, if the card number is eligible and participates in the 3D program.

 | _check-payer-response_ forwards the PARes, which is a digitally signed XML document to _{payment-gateway-abbr}_ for validation.

| _credit_ | Moves funds from the merchant account to the cardholder's account.
| _original-credit_ |Moves funds to the cardholder's account, *without* referring to an eligible _purchase_ or _capture_ (i.e. non-referenced). This transaction type can be used for gambling and non-gambling processes.

|Takes funds from the cardholder's account. A one-step process to conduct two transaction types: _authorization_ and _capture_.

See details for <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction, referencing a transaction>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_VoidRefund]
=== void vs. refund

It is often the case that the merchants must withdraw an online shopping
process. When the consumer wants to buy a product or service online,
{payment-gateway} ({payment-gateway-abbr}) initiates a payment process. When the
merchants withdraw this process, they can stop the process in two ways.
Either with a void or a refund.

A void is only possible as long as no money transfer has been initiated.
As soon as {payment-gateway-abbr} has initiated the payment flow to the acquirer the
merchants must return the funds to the consumer via a refund process.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_VoidRefund_Void_Workflow]
.Workflow

Voiding a transaction requires a reference to the transaction that shall
be voided.

The void transaction contains a ``<parent-transaction-id>`` that refers to
the ``<transaction-id>`` of the transaction that shall be voided.

Here is an example how to void a _capture_.

Refunding a transaction requires a reference to the transaction that
shall be refunded.

The refund transaction contains a ``<parent-transaction-id>`` that refers
to the ``<transaction-id>`` of the transaction that shall be refunded.

Here is an example how to refund a _capture_.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_OctEligibility]
=== OCT Eligibility Check


{payment-gateway} uses the transaction type
_authorization-only_, to find out whether the card in use is eligible
for original credit transactions (OCT). If you want to use this
eligibility check contact mailto:{e-mail-support}[merchant support]
