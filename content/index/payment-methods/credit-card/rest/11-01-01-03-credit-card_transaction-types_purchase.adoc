[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_Introduction]
=== Introduction

_purchase_ transfers the transaction amount without preceding
reservation from the consumer directly to the merchant. With this
transaction type merchants collect the money immediately while selling
goods or providing a service to the consumers. Merchants use _purchase_
in most of the cases to process POS transactions. It is also used for
immediate online payments, such as software downloads.

Merchants can also perform recurring payments using the transaction type
_purchase_. The first payment of a recurring payment process starts with
the transaction type _purchase_ which is followed by
_referenced-purchase_ transactions.


[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_Introduction_RealLife]
.Real-Life Example


[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_Introduction_RealLife_SinglePayment]
*Single Payment*


For POS payments, _purchase_ is used when consumers hire a taxi and pay
the taxi fare with their credit card. Or the consumers shop in a
department store or grocery store and pay at the check out using their
credit card.

In an online shopping process, _purchase_ is used when consumers
download software, a movie or audio files.


[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_Introduction_RealLife_RecurringPayment]
*Recurring Payment*

When consumers subscribe to a magazine or pay an insurance, they face
periodically repeating payments for a certain period of time. When
consumers want to pay online, merchants can arrange this type of payment
with the transaction type _referenced-purchase_
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_ReferencingPurchaseTransactions, referencing a _purchase_ transaction>>.


[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_AvailabilityRestrictions]
=== Availability and Restrictions

No restrictions apply to this transaction type. A _purchase_ is
generally available.

A
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_VoidPurchase, _void-purchase_>>
can stop a successfully completed
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_PurchaseUsingCardData, _purchase_>>
(merchant received a success _purchase_ notification) as long as the
funds transfer has not been initiated. The same logic applies to void a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_RefundPurchase, _refund-purchase_>>.
That means, a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_VoidRefundPurchase, _void-refund-purchase_>>
can stop a _refund-purchase_. If merchants want to cancel the _purchase_
after the funds transfer was initiated, they must do it with a
_refund-purchase_.

A _referenced-purchase_ is only possible, if there is a preceding
successful _purchase_ transaction to refer to, which contains a
``<periodic-type>`` and a ``<sequence-type>``.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_AvailabilityRestrictions_Sequence]
.Sequence

A _purchase_ can be a stand-alone transaction. It may be followed by a
_void-purchase,_ a _referenced-purchase_ or a _refund-purchase_. A
_refund-purchase_ may be followed by a _void-refund-purchase_.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData]
=== Sending Data

We only list samples for requests and responses. Notifications follow
the general structure described in
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, General Platform Features>>.

Are you using
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_RunningTestSamples, Postman>> to send the requests?

- If yes, you can use the samples as provided below (_Request Header_ and _Request Sample_).
- If no, replace ``{{$guid}}`` with a globally unique ID in ``<request-id>``.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_StatusCodes]
.Status Codes

In ``<statuses>`` of the response you will find a number that represents a
<<StatusCodes, status code>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_PurchaseUsingCardData]
._purchase_ Using Card Data

*Request*

If the credit card is used for the first time, the _purchase_ request
will contain the explicit card data. The first response immediately
replaces the explicit card data with a token. The token will be used
from then on.

Read how a
<<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization, token replaces the clear credit card data>>.

Handling explicit card data requires a strong degree of PCI DSS
compliance. If your PCI DSS compliance is not sufficient, you can use our
<<PPv2, {payment-page-v2}>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_ReferencingPurchaseTransactions]
.Referencing _purchase_ Transactions

<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring, Recurring transactions>> can be referenced using
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_ReferencingTransaction, ``<parent-transaction-id>``>>.

The following sample set describes a flow of recurring _purchase_
transactions which are connected via ``<parent-transaction-id>``.

_The Initial Transaction_ +
The initial transaction is a _purchase_. It contains a ``<periodic>``:
``<periodic-type>`` = recurring and ``<sequence-type>`` = first.

_The Recurring Transactions_ +
There can be multiple recurring transactions. Each recurring transaction
is a _referenced-purchase_. It contains a ``<periodic>``:
``<periodic-type>`` = recurring and ``<sequence-type>`` = recurring.

_The Final Transaction_ +
The final transaction is a _referenced-purchase_. It contains a
``<periodic>``: ``<periodic-type>`` = recurring and ``<sequence-type>`` =
final.

_The ``<parent-transaction-id>``_ +
``<parent-transaction-id>`` of the _referenced-purchase_ is always the
same as ``<transaction-id>`` of the initial _purchase_.
