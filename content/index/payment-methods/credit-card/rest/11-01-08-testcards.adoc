[#API_CC_TestCards]
== Test Cards
In this section we provide test cards for a variety of card brands. 
These test cards allow you to trigger a certain behaviour when you send them to our
endpoint. We provide test cards for _3D Secure,_ _3D Secure 2,_ and _Non-3D Secure_ transactions.

.Example
If you want to provoke the error status code ``500.1072`` ("_Card Not Enrolled_.")
in combination with a Visa card for a _3D Secure_ transaction, use
_Card Number_ ``4012000300006002``, _Expiration Date_ ``{cc-exp-month}/{cc-exp-year}`` and _CVC_ ``002``.

[#API_CC_TestCards_3D]
=== 3D Secure Transactions

When you do a <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, _3D Secure_ transaction>>,
{payment-gateway-abbr} checks with the first request, whether the card is enrolled in _3D Secure_.
A transaction is _3D Secure_, if the response returns a positive enrollment
check and a positive authentication result.

[#API_CC_TestCards_Non3D_Process]
=== Non-3D Secure Transactions

This section provides card numbers and CVCs which you can use to provoke certain
Non-3D responses.
To obtain the required response, send a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_PurchaseUsingCardData, _purchase_>>
request to our endpoint using the corresponding card details provided here.

For example: If you want to provoke the message "The card type is not processed
by the authorization center.  Please contact technical support."
(Status Code = ``500.1061``) for a MAESTRO card,
send a _purchase_ request and use the Card Number ``6333111900920000``,
Expiration Date ``{cc-exp-month}/{cc-exp-year}`` and CVC ``999``.
