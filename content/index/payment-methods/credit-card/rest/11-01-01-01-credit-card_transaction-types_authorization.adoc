[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_Introduction]

_authorization_ checks the consumer's account for credibility and
reserves a fixed amount of funds. Reservation means that {payment-gateway} informs the card holder's issuer about the upcoming
transaction. The reservation lasts from three to thirty days, depending
on the acquirer and card brand. Within that time the merchants can
prepare the selected products or services for shipping. Once the
merchants initiate the shipping, they also initiate a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization, _capture-authorization_>>
which will transfer the authorized amount from the issuer to the
acquirer.

NOTE: *authorization, preauthorization or final-authorization* +
The functionality of an _authorization_ as described in this section can
also be configured as _preauthorization_ or _final-authorization_. Which
one shall be your choice, strongly depends on your business case, the
acquirer and the credit card brand. Please consult your sales
representative for details.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_Introduction_RealLife]
.Real-Life Example

Consumers order a dishwasher for 500 EUR online. _authorization_ checks
the consumers' account immediately and reserves 500 EUR. When the
merchants start the shipping process,
a <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization, _capture-authorization_>>
will transfer the 500 EUR from the consumers' to the merchants' account.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_AvailabilityRestrictions]
=== Availability and Restrictions

_authorization_ is generally available.

Every _authorization_ request has a time limit depending on the card
schemes. The limit refers to the period of time from sending an
_authorization_ to sending a _capture-authorization_. Typically, the
limit ranges from three to thirty days, depending on the acquirer and
card brand. It is recommended to check the card schemes for details. An
_authorization_ may be denied. Some reasons (among others) for the
denial are:

- The consumer's credit limit is reached.
- The card was blocked.
- A fraud case is suspected by the issuer.
- The card itself expired.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_AvailabilityRestrictions_Sequence]
==== Sequence

An _authorization_ reserves funds on the cardholder's account. It may
be followed by a <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_SendingData_VoidAuthorization, _void-authorization_>> or a <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization, _capture-authorization_>>.
As an _authorization_ merely reserves funds there is only a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_VoidRefund, void possible but no refund>>.

A _capture-authorization_ may be followed by either a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization_SendingData_VoidCapture, _void-capture_>> or a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization_SendingData_RefundCapture, _refund-capture_>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_SendingData_StatusCodes]
==== Status Codes

In ``<statuses>`` of the response you will find a number that represents a
<<StatusCodes, status code>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_SendingData_AuthorizationUsingCardData]
===== _authorization_ Using Card Data

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization_SendingData_AuthorizationUsingCardData_Req]
====== Request

If the credit card is used for the first time, the _authorization_
request will contain the clear card data. The first response immediately
replaces the explicit card data with a token. The token will be used
from then on.

Read how a
<<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization, token replaces the clear credit card data>>.

Handling clear card data requires a strong degree of PCI DSS compliance.
If your PCI DSS compliance is not sufficient, you can use our
<<PPv2, {payment-page-v2}>>.

We provide detailed descriptions of all
<<CC_Fields, _credit card_ fields>>.
