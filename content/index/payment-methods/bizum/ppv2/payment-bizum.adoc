:payment-method-name: Bizum

_Bizum_ is a free payment system supported by most Spanish banks that allows consumers who have an account with the bank to make payments. Before using the Bizum payment method, consumers must first https://www.bancosantander.es/en/particulares/banca-online/apps/santander[install the Santander app] and https://www.bancosantander.es/en/particulares/banca-online/pagos/bizum/clave-bizum[obtain their Bizum password]. When using Bizum, consumers are redirected to Bizum to verify and complete their payments using either their Santander app or Bizum password. For more information on Bizum, see https://www.bancosantander.es/en/particulares/banca-online/pagos/bizum.

_Bizum_ is a type of Offline Bank Transfer and can be used by all 3 Payment Page implementations (Hosted Payment Page, Embedded Payment Page, and Seamless).

[#PPv2_PaymentBizum_TransactionType_authorization]
=== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ is used to confirm the status of the consumer’s authentication in Bizum. The _authorization_ does not reserve the funds in the account.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

NOTE: You can also use the ``AUTO-SALE`` pseudo transaction type with the Bizum payment method. For more information, see <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions, transaction features>>.

[#PPv2_PaymentBizum_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations

{payment-page-abbr} is best used for one-off payments. It is also best used if you are not PCI compliant, as {payment-page-abbr} collects the necessary data on your behalf.
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as capturing one of your _authorization_ transactions or refunding a _capture-authorization_ transaction - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<API_PaymentBizum, _{payment-method-name}_ specification>> for details on _{payment-method-name}_ -specific post-processing operations.
