[#PPv2_PayPal_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _PayPal_. Here you'll find all the
information necessary for integrating this payment method in
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page. 

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for
<<PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>,
<<PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_authorization, _authorization_>>,
<<PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_authorizationonly, _authorization-only_>> and
<<PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_order, _order_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact our <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> section.

For response verification examples, see

[#PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A debit transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the customer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_PayPal_ payment form.

|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your customer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

The customers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- ``success``ful (``transaction-state: success``),
- ``failed`` (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The customer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as  _failed_, but the status description indicates it
was canceled.

In any case (unless the customer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_authorization]

An _authorization_ transaction places the account holder's funds on hold,

As with other referenceable transaction types, you can use {payment-page-v2-abbr} only to
create the authorization itself. To capture or register additional
transactions referencing it, you need to use our <<RestApi, REST API>>. 

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the customer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

[#PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_authorizationonly]
=== Transaction Type _authorization-only_

An authorization-only transaction creates a _PayPal_ billing agreement
between the merchant and account holder, obtaining authorization for
pre-approved payments.

This transaction type requires specific fields in the request:

- ``periodic-type``, set to value _recurring_ or _installment_.
- ``sequence-type``, set to value _first_.
- The ``value`` field of ``requested-amount`` set to zero.

//-

The periodic and sequence information indicates that this is the first
transaction in a series. The zero transaction amount is required because
this is only an agreement for future transactions, not a charge.
The ``provider-transaction-reference-id`` field returned in the response
contains the ID used to reference the billing agreement.

As with other referenceable transactions, you can use {payment-page-v2-abbr} only to create
this initial billing agreement. For all following transactions (i.e.
capturing the _authorization_), you need to use
our <<RestApi, REST API>>.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the customer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You

[#PPv2_PayPal_TransactionType_order]
=== Transaction Type _order_

_order_ is a _PayPal_-specific transaction type, which indicates that the
buyer has consented to the purchase but does not place the funds on
hold. For detailed information on how it works, see its
<<API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific_order, REST API specification>>.

After merchant creates an order, they can place multiple authorizations
upon it to place funds on hold until ready to capture. This transaction
is primarily for situations where items are not available for shipment
immediately after the order is placed, e.g.:

- when a merchant ships items from multiple distribution centers and
needs separate authorizations for each shipment,
- delayed shipping on items that are not in stock.

//-

As with other referenceable transaction types, you can use {payment-page-v2-abbr} only to
create an order transaction. To register an additional authorization to
capture it, you need to use our <<PPv2_PayPal_PostProcessing, REST API>>.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the customer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

<<PPv2_PayPal_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _PayPal_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it's
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_PayPal_ payment form.

After the merchant creates an _order_, they can place multiple
authorizations upon it to place funds on hold until ready to _capture_.

Merchants often use this technique to accept orders for items that are
not available for shipment when the order is placed. For example, when a
merchant ships items from multiple distribution centers and needs
separate _authorizations_ for each shipment. Another example would be
delayed shipping on items that are not in stock.

[#PPv2_PayPal_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations

{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

WARNING: Check the REST API
<<API_PaymentMethods_PayPal, _PayPal_ specification>> for details on
_PayPal_ specific post processing operations.

There are multiple post processing operations available for _PayPal_:

- _capture_ operations for both _authorization_ and _authorization-only_
- recurring transactions
- void transactions
- refunds

//-

For examples and more information, see the REST
API <<API_PaymentMethods_PayPal, _PayPal_ specification>>.
