[#payolution_Workflow]
=== Workflow

[#payolution_InvoiceB2C]
==== Invoice B2C (_authorization, capture-authorization_)

[NOTE]
====
_payolution_ sends the _authorization_ request with the _payolution_
specific payment method "*payolution-inv*".

For B2C transactions, the account holder's date of birth is mandatory.

Invoice B2C captures the full amount only when *all the ordered goods*
are ready for delivery.
====

image::images/11-23-payolution/payolution_InvoiceB2C_authorization_captureAuthorization.png[payolution Invoice B2C, width=950, align="right"]

[#payolution_InvoiceB2B]
==== Invoice B2B (_authorization, capture-authorization_)

[NOTE]
====
_Invoice B2B_ has the same structure as _Invoice B2C_.

_Invoice B2B_ sends the _authorization_ request with the _payolution_
specific payment method "*payolution-b2b*".

For B2B transactions, a company name is required.

Invoice B2B captures the full amount only when *all ordered goods* are
ready for delivery.
====

image::images/11-23-payolution/payolution_InvoiceB2B_authorization_captureAuthorization.png[payolution Invoice B2B, width=950, align="right"]

[#payolution_Installment]
==== Installment (_authorization, capture-authorization_)

[NOTE]
====
_Installment_ sends the _authorization_ request with the _payolution_
specific payment method "*payolution-inst*".

_Capture-authorization_ must be triggered *immediately after the
authorization* response has arrived.
====

image::images/11-23-payolution/payolution_Installment_authorization_captureAuthorization.png[payolution Installment, width=950, align="right"]

[#payolution_Reversal]
==== Reversal (_void-authorization_)

A reversal cancels an authorized order and blocks it for future
captures. Only full reversals of the non-captured amount are supported.
Reversals should not be possible for installment transactions (capture
should follow authorization immediately).

[NOTE]
====
_Reversal_ sends the _authorization_ request with the _payolution_
specific payment method "*payolution-inv*".

_Reversal_ sends a partial _capture_ request when *some of the
items* are ready for delivery.

Only the fully authorized amount that has not been captured can be
voided. Partial void authorizations are not possible.
====

image::images/11-23-payolution/payolution_reversal_voidAuthorization.png[payolution Reversal, width=950, align="right"]

[#payolution_Refund]
==== Refund (_refund-capture_)

[NOTE]
====
A refund request must be sent in case of goods returned by the consumer.

Refunds can also be used for invoice reduction or settlement of faulty
payments with the merchant account.

The refund workflow applies to both Invoice and Installment
transactions.
====

[NOTE]
====
_Refund_ sends the _authorization_ request with the _payolution_
specific payment method "*payolution-inv*".

_Refund_ sends a _capture_-_authorization_ request when *all the
items* are ready for delivery.

Multiple _captures_ are allowed in case that only part of the order is
ready for delivery.

Sends _refund-capture_ request with the amount of returned items.
