[#PPv2_blik_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _blik_. Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type
<<PPv2_blik_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> 
section.

For response verification examples, see
the <<PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security, {payment-page-v2-abbr} Security>> section.


[#PPv2_blik_About]
=== About blik

Blik is an alternative payment method in Poland that allows users to make instant payments and withdraw cash using only the user's standard mobile banking app.
Transactions are uniquely identified by a 6-digit one-time code, valid for 2 minutes, which the user generates and authenticates in their mobile banking app

*blik Sandbox Credentials*

Our test environment is connected to the _blik_ sandbox which does not
require you to enter any additional data. The _blik_ landing page will ask
you to select a bank. You will be redirected to a page that asks for
payment confirmation. Upon confirmation of your test payment, _blik_
immediately returns you to your shop.

[#PPv2_blik_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<PPv2_blik_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _blik_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url | String | The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.
