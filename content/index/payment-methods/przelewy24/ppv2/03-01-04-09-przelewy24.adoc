[#PPv2_P24_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _Przelewy24_. Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type
<<PPv2_P24_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> 
section.

For response verification examples, see
the <<PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security, {payment-page-v2-abbr} Security>> section.


[#PPv2_P24_About]
=== About e-przelewy

_e-przelewy (P24)_ offers bank transfers and other payment methods for the
Polish e-commerce sector. 80-90% of online payments in Poland happen via
bank transfer, making _P24_ the most popular payment service in this
region.

Currently, _e-przelewy_ cooperates with 165 banks.

Consumers select the bank of their choice. _P24_ redirects them to that
bank's login page. There, consumers use their bank credentials to log
in, and then initialize the transaction. Upon payment confirmation,
merchants and consumers receive a notification of the transaction
outcome.

*P24 Sandbox Credentials*

Our test environment is connected to the _P24_ sandbox which does not
require you to enter any additional data. The _P24_ landing page will ask
you to select a bank. You will be redirected to a page that asks for
payment confirmation. Upon confirmation of your test payment, _P24_
immediately returns you to your shop.

[#PPv2_P24_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<PPv2_P24_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _P24_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url | String | The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_P24_TransactionType_refund]
=== Transaction Type _refund_

Basically, _P24_ with {payment-page-v2-abbr} supports _debit_ only. You can integrate a
<<Przelewy24_refundProcessUsingtheReSTAPI, refund process for _P24_ via our REST API>>.

You must provide the necessary data:

- ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
debit. You can gather it from the response to a successful debit.
- ``amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund).
