[#Przelewy24_Workflow]
=== Workflow

[#Przelewy24_debitTransaction]
==== _debit_ Transaction

[#Przelewy24_debitPrerequisites]
===== Prerequisites

For a successful workflow, please keep the following prerequisites in
mind:

* A P24 payment process is *accomplished successfully only, if {payment-gateway-abbr} has
sent out a successful notification*. The status ``success`` in the response
only confirms that the payment was technically accepted.
* In case the consumer closes the browser before confirming the payment,
there is *a redirection to shop page* possible. This means, the workflow
can be accomplished successfully, even when shutting down the browser.
* As soon as the P24 landing page has been opened in a browser,
the *consumer has 15 minutes to authorize the payment*. However, the
validity of the received URL is not limited. Try to ensure that the URL
is opened by the consumer as soon as possible. In edge cases the payment
could be successfully finished even after a long time (when the merchant
could have cancelled the order already).
* The maximum period to receive notification is 30 days.

[#Przelewy24_debitProcessUsingtheReSTAPI]
===== Payment Process Using the ReST API

image::images/diagrams/przelewy24_debit_rest.svg[Payment Process Using ReST API]

. The consumer initiates a transaction (currency is set to ``PLN``).
. The merchant sends a request with the consumer's data to the
endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a response to the merchant.
. The merchant redirects the consumer to the P24 landing page (The URL
for redirection is in the response message, field
``payment-methods/payment-method/@url``).
. The consumer authorizes the transaction.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} performs two actions simultaneously:
. {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer (via redirect URLs) back to the shop
where the information about the status of the payment is displayed. The
redirect URL uses the definition in ``success-redirect-url`` and
``fail-redirect-url`` from the request (Step 2). According to success or
failure during the payment process {payment-gateway-abbr} sends the consumer to the
corresponding URL. This is the page where the consumer is informed about
his successful or failed payment.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome. In order to
receive server-to-server notification, the notification must use the
definition in the field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request
(Step 2)

[#Przelewy24_debitProcessUsingthePaymentPage]
===== Payment Process Using the Payment Page

.Payment Process Using Payment Page
image::images/diagrams/przelewy24_debit_pp.svg[Payment Process Using Payment Page]

. The consumer initiates a transaction (currency is set to PLN).
. The merchant sends a request with the consumer's data to the
endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} analyses the consumer's data.
.. If the request does not include the payment method P24, the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_
redirects the consumer to Payment Page
... The consumer selects P24.
... {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer to the P24 landing page.
.. If the request already includes the payment method P24, _{payment-gateway-abbr}_
redirects the consumer to the P24 landing page.
. The consumer selects the desired bank.
. The consumer authorizes the transaction.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} performs two actions simultaneously:
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer (via redirect URLs) back to the shop
where the information about the status of the payment is displayed. The
redirect URL uses the definition
in ``success-redirect-url`` and ``fail-redirect-url`` from the request (Step
2). According to success or failure during the payment process {payment-gateway-abbr} sends
the consumer to the corresponding URL. This is the page where the
consumer is informed about his successful or failed payment.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome. In order to
receive a server-to-server notification, the notification must use the
definition in the field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request
(Step 2).

[#Przelewy24_refundTransaction]
==== _refund_ Transaction

A ``refund`` transaction is a backend process. Getnet can only provide a
process for ReST API. When using Payment Page the merchant must set up a
refund process.

[#Przelewy24_refundPrerequisites]
===== Prerequisites

In order to transfer funds back to the consumer you have to be aware of
the following prerequisites:

* The flow is asynchronous. You have to wait for a notification with the
result. Usually it takes one day for refunds to be processed.
* The _refund_ must reference to a successful ``debit`` transaction. In a
_refund_, a _Transaction ID_ from a ``debit`` notification must be
used.
* The refunded amount must be less than or equal to original ``debit``
transaction
* Multiple refunds to a single ``debit`` are possible as long as the sum
of those individual refunds does not exceed original full amount.
* In order to have a final status of the _refund_, you have to process a
subsequent notification.

[#Przelewy24_refundProcessUsingtheReSTAPI]
===== _refund_ Process Using the ReST API

.refund Process Using the ReST API
image::images/diagrams/przelewy24_refund_rest.svg[refund Process Using the ReST API]

. The merchant initiates a ``refund`` transaction.
. The merchant sends a request to the endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_. The request
must contain:
.. the _Request ID_ from a previously sent successful ``debit``
transaction. The _Request ID_ is expected in the
field ``parent-transaction-id``
.. a ``payment-methods/payment-method/@name`` set to ``p24``
.. a ``transaction-type`` set to ``refund-request``
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a response to the merchant.
. P24 processes the refund.
+
NOTE: Processing a refund lasts at least one day!

+
. {payment-gateway-abbr} waits for the status "Refund Process Finished".
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the ``refund`` outcome to the
merchant. This notification has the transaction type ``refund-debit``,
instead of ``refund-request`` which was sent in the merchant's request
(Step 2).  +
In order to receive a server-to-server notification, the notification
must use the definition in the
field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request (Step 2).
See <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification>> for details.

[#Przelewy24_BankingStatement]
==== Banking Statement

After a successful payment process, a banking statement appears in the
consumer's transaction history. The statement consists of
a _Transaction-ID_ generated by P24 (_P24-Transaction-ID_) and a value
provided in the field ``descriptor`` of the <<Przelewy24_Samples_debit, debit request>>.

The structure of the _P24-Transaction-ID_ is
``P24-YXX-XXX-XXX``. _The _P24-Transaction-ID__ is also displayed in
the _{enterprise-portal-name}_ as _Provider Transaction-ID_.
