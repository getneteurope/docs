|authorization    |Performs a creditworthiness check at the moment when
                   the consumer makes an order. All order items must be listed for the shopping
                   basket. The authorization amount must match the value of the items in
                   the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Direct Debit samples>>

|capture-authorization |Used to capture the reserved funds at the moment
                        when some or all goods are physically delivered to the consumer.
                        Available only on successful ``authorization`` response which wasn't voided
                        nor fully captured. Partial (and multiple) capture is allowed, as long as
                        the authorization limit is not exceeded. Basket items only list the
                        items that were delivered to the consumer in this delivery, not the ones
                        that were delivered before or are waiting to be delivered. The total
                        amount of the capture must be the value of the items in the basket.
                                | <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Direct Debit samples>>

|void-authorization |Used when the consumer wishes to cancel some or all
                     (not yet shipped) items from the order. Available only for a successful
                     ``authorization`` response which was not yet voided or captured. Partial and
                     multiple void are allowed, until all items from the order are canceled
                     or shipped. Basket items only list those items which are canceled from the order.
                                | <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Direct Debit samples>>

|refund-capture |Used when the consumer wishes to return some or all
                 delivered goods. Available on a successful ``capture-authorization``.
                 Partial and multiple refunds are allowed, until all delivered items have
                 been returned. Basket items list only those items which are returned to the merchant.
                                | <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Direct Debit samples>>

|credit |Used when the merchant wishes to grant a discount on an existing
         order. Items from this order may already be delivered to the consumer.
         Available on a successful ``capture-authorization``. Multiple credits are
         allowed, but the overall sum of credits may not exceed the value of the goods delivered to the consumer. The credit transaction must include a
         basket item representing the discount. The credit transaction must refer
         to the successful authorization transaction ID.
                                | <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_Samples_DirectDebit, Direct Debit samples>>

[NOTE]
====
. <<API_PaymentDirectDebit_BasketItemsDetails, Basket items>>  must be specified in every request.
. The response for each ``authorization`` request returns an individual
string (an alphanumerical code, starting with DG) in the
``descriptor`` field.
. The descriptor must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by
the shop (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:"Verwendungszweck").­
. ``capture-authorization`` transactions must follow a successful
``authorization`` on the same day the goods are dispatched.
. The period between ``authorization`` and the first
``capture-authorization`` must be at least 4 hours.
. Merchants can request partial ``capture-authorizations`` if the goods
are shipped in separate shipments.

The shopping basket always contains the items that are being authorized

or credited depending to the transaction type.

The detailed items of the shopping basket will be stored as a part of
payment details on provider and they can be obtained from {payment-gateway} later as part of transaction details.

Regular consumers who pay their bills on time are important capital for
each merchant. With Getnet, merchants can use this capital as a
payment method.

To accomplish that, merchants submit a list with the order and
payment history of their consumers to Getnet.

https://wcdwl.ratepay.com/index.php/en/overview.html[Here] you can
find which format (and content) you need for the list and how to upload
it.

[#API_PaymentDirectDebit_ConsenttoGeneralTermsandConditions]
==== Consent to General Terms and Conditions

During checkout, the consumer has to agree to Getnet's general terms
and conditions. They have to give their consent by ticking an
appropriate checkbox.
