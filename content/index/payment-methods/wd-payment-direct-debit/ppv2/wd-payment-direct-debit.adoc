[#PPv2_PaymentDirectDebit_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations

{payment-page-abbr} is best used for one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<API_PaymentDirectDebit, _{payment-method-name}_ specification>> for details on _{payment-method-name}_ -specific post-processing operations.
