==== Transaction Types

For <<Glossary_TransactionType, transaction type>> details which are not given here look
at <<AppendixB,  Transaction Types>>.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Transaction Type | Description | Link to the Samples

| _authorization_ | Verifies payment details for structural validity and /
or generates a reference ID for the merchant (not mandatory). | 
| _pending-credit_ | The credit has been accepted by the payment gateway
| See <<SEPACreditTransfer_Samples_PendingCredit, samples>>.
| _void-pending-credit_ | Voids a _pending-credit_. +
Only available when the <<SEPA_TransactionType_Void_Restrictions, restrictions>> are met.
| See <<SEPACreditTransfer_Samples_VoidPendingCredit, samples>>.
| _credit_ | The credit has been processed and confirmed by Santander Bank. A notification will be sent once the transaction reaches this state and the merchant should await the credit transaction, which confirms the fund transfer is successful, before releasing the goods.
Please note: there can be a delay of 1-2 business days before the transaction is confirmed.
 |
| _credit-return_ | The payment is returned by the consumer bank. See <<SEPA_ReturnCodes, Return Codes>>. |
|===

NOTE: Recurring Transactions are *not* supported for _SEPA Credit Transfer_.

NOTE: The transaction type within the request must be _credit_ or
_pending-credit._ A _credit_ will be transformed into a _pending-credit_ by default.


[#SEPACreditTransfer_TransactionTypes_refund]
._refund_

_SEPA Credit Transfer_ may be used as a method for merchants to return
funds to consumers. If it is being used as a way for the merchant to
refund a specific _debit_ transaction, it is recommended that a
_parent-transaction ID_ (i.e. the _transaction ID_ of the successful
_Debit_) is included in the request in order to be able to match the
_refund_ to the original transaction.

[#SEPACreditTransfer_TransactionTypes_void]
._void_

SEPA _void_ can be used with both SEPA payment methods: _SEPA Credit Transfer_ and _SEPA Direct Debit._

[#SEPACreditTransfer_Transactions_ExecutionDate]
==== Execution Date

NOTE: This is the date on which the transfer will be executed. According to
SEPA regulations, it is required to be one (1) business day after it has
entered the banking system. This date is set by the system during
processing and is not part of the request or the response.

. The transaction type within the request must be _credit_ or _pending-credit._
. If the request is successful, a response will be returned with status
_Success_. This response means that the transaction has entered the
{payment-gateway} successfully. The transaction itself is in a _pending_
status, waiting to be sent to the merchant's bank.
. If the request is not successful, a response will be returned with
status _Failed_. *The response always contains a status code and a description.*
Please read this description carefully as it will help to
understand why the transaction request has failed and what needs to be
fixed in order to send a successful transaction request.
. Once the transaction has been successfully sent to and processed by
the bank, a new transaction with type _credit_ will be created in status
_Success_. This process usually takes up to 2 business days. The
transaction will then be forwarded the Central Bank for processing.
. If the transaction has been rejected by the merchant's bank, a
_credit_ transaction on status _Failed_ will be created and the
transaction will not be sent to the Central Bank.
. The merchant will receive a notification of the _credit_ transaction.

NOTE: Although a transaction has been successfully processed by the merchant's
bank, the transaction may still be reversed by the consumer's bank for
reasons such as insufficient funds, account owner deceased, bank account
closed, etc. In this case, a _credit-return_ transaction will be created
and matched to the original _credit_ transaction to ensure the merchant
has a complete overview for his debtor management. For a full list of
_credit-return_ reasons, please refer to the list of <<SEPA_ReturnCodes, SEPA Return Codes>>.

The merchant can request the status of the transaction at any time by
sending a "<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Transaction ID>>"
or "<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestID, Retrieve Transaction by Request ID>>".

[#SEPACreditTransfer_Fields]
=== Fields

The fields used for SEPA _Credit Transfer_ requests, responses and
notifications are the same as the REST API fields. Please refer to:
<<RestApi_Fields, REST API Fields>>.

Only the fields listed below have different properties.

The following elements are mandatory (M), optional (O) or conditional
\(C) for a request/response/notification.

[%autowidth, cols="1,2,3,4,5,6,7a"]
|===
| Field | Request | Response | Notification | Datatype | Size | Description

| descriptor | O | O | O | String | 100 | Description on the settlement of the account holder's account about a
transaction.

For SEPA Credit Transfer transactions, it will be combined with the
Provider Transaction Reference ID and the merchant's static
descriptor and will appear on the consumer's bank account statement.
| payment-methods.payment-method-Name | M | M | M | String | 15 | This is the name of the payment method _sepacredit_.
| api-id |   |   | M | api-id | 25 | The API id is always returned in the notification. For SEPA it is
"---"
| bank-account.bic | O | O | O | String | 8 or 11 | This is the Business Identifier Code of the bank of the end-consumer. In SEPA Area where <<SEPA_Reporting_IbanOnly, IBAN Only>> is enabled, BIC is an optional field.
| bank-account.iban | C | C | C | String | 34 | This is the International Bank Account Number of the end-consumer.

If no parent-transaction-id is provided, it remains mandatory.

| provider-transaction-reference-id |   | M | M | String | 10 | This ID provides a reference for the complete end-to-end lifecycle of a
SEPA Credit Transfer transaction. It is used as a reference within the
banking system to ensure all transactions referencing each other (eg: a
_credit_ and a _debit-return_) are matched and that the complete
lifecycle of a payment is identifiable. Getnet generates this ID for
the merchant.
| account-holder.last-name | M | M | M | String | 32 | This is the last name of the end-consumer.
