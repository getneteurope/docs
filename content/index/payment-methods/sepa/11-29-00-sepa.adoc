[#SEPA]
== SEPA
Getnet offers two SEPA payment methods.

- <<SEPACreditTransfer, SEPA Credit Transfer>>
- <<SEPADirectDebit, SEPA Direct Debit>>
//-

_SEPA Direct Debit_ is very popular in Germany, Austria and the
Netherlands.

[#SEPA_TransactionTypes]
=== Transaction Types

The following transaction types may be used with both _SEPA Direct Debit_
and _SEPA Credit Transfer_ payment methods. For payment method
specific transaction types, please refer to the individual payment
method pages.

[#SEPA_TransactionType_Void]
==== SEPA _void_

{payment-gateway} allows merchants to void _SEPA Direct Debit_
and _SEPA Credit Transfer_ transactions *before* they are forwarded to
the bank for settlement.

This means: It is only possible to void a transaction between the
time the transaction request has been received by the {payment-gateway}
for processing and the time the transaction will
be forwarded for processing to the bank. Once the payment was processed
by the bank and settled, it is no longer possible to void a transaction.

[NOTE]
====
To void an existing pending _SEPA Direct Debit_ or SEPA _Credit
Transfer_ transaction, a merchant must

- send a _void-pending-debit_ or _void-pending-credit_ request.
- include the parent-transaction-ID.
//-
====

[#SEPA_TransactionType_Void_Restrictions]
===== Restrictions

To ensure proper processing, please take into consideration the
following restrictions for SEPA _Void_ transactions:

- A _pending-debit_ or _pending-credit_ transaction may only be voided
*before* the transaction is batched into a file and sent to the bank for
processing.

NOTE: Batch processing starts at around 10:00 UTC.

- If a _void_ request is sent after the transaction has been sent to the
bank, a _Failed_ response will be returned.
- Once a corresponding _debit_ or _credit_ transaction exists for the
original _pending-debit_ or _pending-credit_ it is no longer possible to
void a transaction.
- A request for a _void_ transaction must contain a parent-transaction
ID referring to the _pending-debit_ or _pending-credit_ transaction
that should be voided.
//-

[#SEPA_TransactionType_Void_Fields]
===== Fields

The fields used for SEPA _Void_ requests, responses and notifications
are the same as the REST API fields. Please refer to <<RestApi_Fields, REST API Fields>>
or the request example for the fields required in a
<<SEPADirectDebit_Samples_VoidPendingDebit, _void-pending-debit_>> or
<<SEPACreditTransfer_Samples_VoidPendingCredit, _void-pending-credit_>> transaction.

WARNING: If the amount is sent within the request for the _void_ transaction it
will be checked if it is the same amount as in the previous
_pending-debit_ or _pending-credit_ request. Partial cancellations are
currently *not* possible.

Only the fields listed below have different properties.

The following elements are mandatory (M) or optional (O) for a
request/response/notification. If the respective cell is empty, the
field is disregarded or not sent.

[%autowidth]
|===
|Field           	| Request  | Response	| Notification | Description

|requested-amount | O        | M        | M | This is the amount of the transaction. The amount of the decimal place
is dependent of the currency. Min amount €0.01. Max amount
€999,999,999.99.

If it is sent within the request it will be validated if it is the same amount like in the _pending-debit_ or _pending-credit_ request.

|requested-currency |O      | M         | M | This is the currency of the requested-amount. Only EUR is accepted.
|payment-methods.payment-method-Name | M | M | M | This is the name of the payment method *sepadirectdebit* or
*sepacredit*.
|parent-transaction-id | M | M | M | Transaction ID of the transaction that needs to be voided.
|transaction-type | M | M  | M | This is the type for a transaction. For a SEPA _Void_ request, only
_void-pending-debit_, _void-debit_, _void-pending-credit_ or
_void-credit_ are allowed.
|===

[#SEPA_TransactionType_Deposit]
==== SEPA _deposit_

Occasionally, a consumer send funds back to the merchant, either at the
request of the merchant or through his/her own initiative. There are
several reasons for this such as a re-payment or a subsequent /
supplementary payment for an already existing SEPA _Direct Debit_
transaction.

These supplementary payments enter the {payment-gateway} as
transactions with transaction type _deposit_ and with the payment method
*wiretransfer*.

If the consumer provides the PTRID (Provider Transaction Reference ID)
in the descriptor of his transfer, the {payment-gateway} will
attempt to match the deposit with the original _SEPA Direct Debit_ or
_SEPA Credit Transfer_ transaction. If the PTRID is not provided or it
is not possible to match the transaction, the transaction will
remain unmatched.

[#SEPA_TransactionType_Deposit_Fields]
===== Fields

The following elements are submitted in the IPN
(<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification>>) either mandatory (M) or optional (O):

[%autowidth]
|===
|Field           	| Notification | Description
|request-id | M | This is the identification number of the request on the merchant's side.
*It must be unique for each request.*
|transaction-type | M | This is the type for a transaction. For SEPA Deposit, it is always
_deposit_.
|payment-methods.payment-method-Name | M | This is the name of the payment method *wiretransfer*.

[#SEPA_TransactionType_DebitReturnAndCreditReturn]
==== SEPA _debit-return_ and _credit-return_


A _debit-return_ reverses a _debit_ transaction. It is initiated by the
consumer bank

- if the consumer disputes the transaction
- if there is a problem with the consumer bank account (e.g. bank account
closed)
//-

A _credit-return_ reverses a _credit_ transaction. It is initiated
either by

- the merchant's bank (e.g. insufficient funds)
- the consumer's bank (e.g. bank account closed)
//-

All _debit-returns_ and _credit-returns_ are included in
reconciliation files provided by Santander Bank and sent to the _{payment-gateway}._ The transaction types _debit-return_ and
_credit-return_ are then initiated by the {payment-gateway}. It is not possible for a
merchant to request these transaction types.

If possible, a _debit-return_ or _credit-return_ is matched by the _{payment-gateway} (_{payment-gateway-abbr}_)_ to its original debit/credit, based on the provider transaction
reference ID (PTRID) and the merchant account.

Possible return codes are documented within <<SEPA_ReturnCodes, Return Codes>>.

[#SEPA_Workflow]
===== Workflow

image::images/diagrams/sepa_workflow.svg[SEPA Workflow]

. _Consumer's bank sends a debit-return_ or _credit-return_ to
Santander Bank.
. Santander Bank forwards the transaction to the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} receives the transaction.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} uses the PTRID to find an initial parent _debit_ or parent
_credit_ transaction.
.. If successful, {payment-gateway-abbr} maps the _debit-return_ to _a debit_ or
_credit-return_ to a _credit._
.. if not successful, {payment-gateway-abbr} creates _a debit-return_ or _credit-return_
without reference.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification about the _debit-return_ or _credit-return_
to the merchant.

[#SEPA_DynamicDescriptor]
=== Dynamic Descriptor

Just like _Credit Card_ it is also possible to use a
<<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_DynamicDescriptor, Dynamic Descriptor>> with SEPA.

[#SEPA_Reporting]
=== Reporting

A reconciliation file is available to download by merchants. This allows
merchant to have the most up-to-date status for their transactions. For
more information about the reconciliation file see chapter
<<Reporting_DataReconciliation, Data Reconciliation>> or please contact Getnet Merchant Support.

[#SEPA_Reporting_BankDataValidation]
=== Bank Data Validation

The {payment-gateway} validates the consumer's bank data, to
ensure transactions with faulty bank data are not forwarded to the bank
for processing.

[#SEPA_Reporting_IBANValidation]
==== IBAN Validation

{payment-gateway} validates the consumer's IBAN in the
following manner:

- The validity of the country code within the IBAN
- The validity of the country code within the SEPA scheme
- The structure of the IBAN including:
* the length of the IBAN based on the issuing country
* the position of the bank identifier
* the position of the country code
* the position of the check digits
- Check digit verification
//-

[#SEPA_Reporting_BICValidation]
==== BIC Validation

{payment-gateway} validates the consumer's BIC in the following
manner:

- The length of the BIC may only be either 8 or 11 characters
- The validity of the BIC within the SEPA scheme
//-

[#SEPA_Reporting_IbanOnly]
==== SEPA IBAN _Only_

According to the EU's SEPA migration directive, as of February 1, 2016,
the BIC is no longer required to process cross-border _SEPA Direct Debit_ and SEPA _Credit Transfer_ transactions. The merchant may still
submit the BIC along with the IBAN, however, it is no longer a mandatory
field.

WARNING: Depending on the payment method, some providers may still use the BIC as
support functionality.

[#SEPA_ReturnCodes]
=== Return Codes

bank for several reasons described below.
