[#PPv2_paylib_About]
=== About _Paylib_

_Paylib_ is a French mobile wallet initiated by a collaboration of major French banks. By linking a credit card to their account, _Paylib_ allows consumers to make purchases without having to re-enter their card details. To pay, consumers have to enter their username, password, and a code generated by the _Paylib_ app.

[#PPv2_paylib_Transactions]
=== Transaction Types _debit_ and _authorization_

A _debit_ charges the specified amount from the account holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder's bank account for a later transfer.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).

. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).

. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.


[#PPv2_paylib_Samples]
=== Samples

_Paylib_ can be used with the transaction types <<PPv2_paylib_TransactionType_debitauth_Create, _debit_>> and <<PPv2_paylib_TransactionType_debitauth_Create, _authorization_>>.

We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below. You need to adapt the field values to your system.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Sample Response URL)

----

[%autowidth]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url
| String
| The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled (``transaction-state: failed``) The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission.

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response, in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_paylib_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations

WPP is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions — use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.
